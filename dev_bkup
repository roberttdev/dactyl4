If the GMRs were within the 50 to200% limit, then sequentially narrower criteria would be tested, i.e., 70 to143%. If these narrower criteria were met, then the standard “no-effect”or bioequivalence criteria, 80 to 125%, were to be assessed. The intendedsample size was based on the known variability in the AUC and Cmaxassociated with midazolam. Sample size calculations were based on astudy by Stoch et al. (11), who reported 90% CIs for GMRs of midazolamAUCs based on within-subject AUC variability and midazolam 2-mg oraldoses in the presence of ketoconazole. The natural log-scale standarddeviations (SD) computed from these CIs were 0.22 for AUC and 0.31 forCmax. Twelve subjects provided Ͼ96% power of yielding a 90% CI forAUC or Cmax within 0.5 to 2.0 bounds if the true underlying GMR was1.00. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam t1/2 and Tmax were comparedbetween midazolam alone versus midazolam with PA-824 using the Student t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. If the t1/2 and Tmax data failedtests for normality, only the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results were reported.RESULTSA total of 14 healthy male (n ϭ 10) and female (n ϭ 4) subjectsparticipated in this clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability,and PK parameters of midazolam when coadministered with PA824. All subjects were 19 to 46 years old (mean, 27.2 years), had abody mass index of 18 to 29 (mean, 25.4 kg/m2), and were medically healthy as determined by the principal investigator based ontheir medical history, clinical laboratory results, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination. At both screening and check-in, subjects had negative urine test results foralcohol and other drugs of abuse, such as amphetamines, cannabinoids, and cocaine metabolites. Study participants represented aracially diverse group consisting of one Asian, one black, two Hispanic, and 10 white subjects. All 14 subjects who were enrolled inthe study completed all of the study procedures, and there were nodropouts.Pharmacokinetics. The mean plasma concentrations formidazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam are shown in Fig. 1 and 2,respectively. PK parameters for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam are provided in Table 1.

The predose mean PA-824plasma concentrations Ϯ the SD on days 12, 13, and 14 for theonce-daily administration of 400 mg of PA-824 were 1,637 Ϯ 610,1,581 Ϯ 539, and 1,607 Ϯ 556 ng/ml, respectively. PA-824 plasmaconcentrations showed no sign of additional accumulation, indicating that steady-state had been achieved for PA-824 prior to thedosing of midazolam. These PA-824 plasma concentrations aresimilar to those found in earlier multiple-dose studies using similar doses.The GMRs (90% CI) when midazolam was coadministeredwith PA-824 compared to when midazolam was administeredalone were as follows: Cmax ϭ 83.63% (75.11 to 93.11%),AUC0 –t ϭ 84.61% (74.21 to 96.47%), and AUC0 –ϱ ϭ 84.45%(73.79 to 96.64%).

The 90% CIs for the GMRs of the AUCs and Cmax valueswere not within the “no-effect” limit of 80 to 125%. The totalextent (AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of midazolam decreasedby ca. 15 to 16% when midazolam was coadministered with PA824 compared to when midazolam was administered alone. Basedon the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the midazolamTmax (P ϭ 0.891) and t1/2 (P ϭ 0.893) were not different betweenboth treatments.As seen in Table 2, a statistical analysis of 1-hydroxy midazolam PK parameters demonstrated that the GMRs (90% CI) whenmidazolam was coadministered with PA-824 compared to whenmidazolam was administered alone were as follows: Cmax ϭ105.23% (93.13 to 118.9%), AUC0 –t ϭ 113.98% (105.53 to123.09%), and AUC0 –ϱ ϭ 112.68% (103.07 to 123.18%). Thelower bound of the 90% CIs for the GMRs of the AUCs wasϾ100% but all were within the “no-effect” limit of 80 to 125%.Based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the 1-hydroxy midazolam Tmax (P ϭ 0.988) and t1/2 (P ϭ 1.00) values werenot different between both treatments.Safety and tolerability. PA-824 was well tolerated throughoutthe study and when coadministered with midazolam. No seriousadverse events occurred. The only adverse events reported bymore than one subject during any treatment period were headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. These eventswere reported more commonly by subjects during the periodswhen PA-824 was administered alone or in combination withmidazolam. There was a trend toward increased serum creatinineconcentrations during dosing with PA-824, a ﬁnding consistentwith an earlier study that determined that higher doses of PA-824do not affect renal function but may increase serum creatinine byinhibiting renal tubular secretion of creatinine, a clinically benigneffect that has been seen with several marketed drugs (12). Mean(SD) serum creatinine concentrations were 0.785 (0.173) atcheck-in, 0.811 (0.184) when midazolam was dosed alone, 0.916(0.175) after 7 days of once-daily dosing of PA-824, and 0.955(0.189) after 14 days of once-daily dosing of PA-824 with coadministration of midazolam on day 14. All other mean laboratoryparameters for serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis remained within reference range. There were no remarkable ﬁndings in the vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, visual acuitytests, and slit-lamp examinations in this study.3702 aac.asm.orgDISCUSSIONWhen this study was designed, the clinical dose range in patientswith TB had not been determined. The 400-mg PA-824 dose usedhere was chosen as the highest dose that might be used in futureclinical studies. The 400-mg PA-824 dose was expected to producethe maximum change in midazolam exposure relevant to theclinic. Any effects observed at the 400-mg PA-824 dose level couldbe extrapolated to lower doses of PA-824, potentially requiringadditional studies to appropriately characterize the drug interaction at lower clinical doses. The 50 to 200% limit for the 90% CI ofthe GMR was chosen as a “no-effect” criterion based on a clinicalassessment that if dose adjustment of important drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 were required during coadministration of PA824, then continued development of PA-824 as a therapy for TBwould not be warranted. The 2-mg oral midazolam dose is at thelower range of that typically used in drug-drug interaction studies,but it was chosen due to concerns over the possible magnitude ofCYP3A4 time-dependent inhibition after a 14-day dosing of PA824.The total extent (AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of midazolam decreased by ca. 16 and 15%, respectively, with the concomitant coadministration of midazolam and PA-824 400 mg compared to the administration of midazolam alone. The total extent(AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of 1-hydroxy midazolam increased 14 and 5%, respectively, with the concomitant coadministration of midazolam and PA-824 compared to the administration of midazolam alone. The 90% CI values for the GMRs ofAUC0 –t, AUC0Ϫϱ, and Cmax for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam were all within the prespeciﬁed “no-effect” 50 to 200% limitand within the narrower prespeciﬁed 70 to 143% limit, whereasonly the 1-hydroxy midazolam GMRs also fell within the defaultbioequivalence 80 to 125% limit. The relatively small decrease inmidazolam exposure, together with the small increase in 1-hydroxy midazolam exposure observed when midazolam is coadministered, appears to be consistent with a small inductive effectby PA-824 on CYP3A4. This result appears inconsistent with invitro data indicating that PA-824 is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4and exhibits metabolism-dependent inhibition. However, our invitro metabolism data are too limited to indicate the likely mechanism. It has been reported that some metabolism-dependent inhibiters can form relatively stable PA-824 metabolite enzymecomplexes resulting in decreased degradation of the enzyme itselfAntimicrobial Agents and ChemotherapyDownloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on May 14, 2014 by guestan, number of subjects contributing data; Cmax, maximum observed concentration; AUC0 –t, area under the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval; AUC0 –ϱ, areaunder the concentration-time curve extrapolated to inﬁnity; LS mean, least-squares mean; GMR, geometric mean ratio; CI, conﬁdence interval.	20384	26407

Midazolam is known to exhibit allosteric activation of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism with some drugs. Allosteric activation involvesthe binding of an “activator” to the enzyme, resulting in an increased rate of metabolism. 1-Hydroxy midazolam forms a glucuronide metabolite. Glucuronide metabolites can be excreted bytransporters in the kidney and other tissues. Increased serum creatinine concentrations were detected. It is possible that PA-824inhibition of a common transporter for creatinine and 1-hydroxymidazolam might have led to the increased 1-hydroxy midazolamexposure that we observed. However, the decrease in midazolamexposure that we detected is not consistent with the inhibition of arenal transporter.We demonstrated that PA-824 at the 400-mg dose does notproduce changes in midazolam exposure that would require doseadjustment. Any changes in midazolam exposure that occur forthe 100- and 200-mg PA-824 doses are likely to be even less thanthat observed for the 400-mg dose. Therefore, our ﬁndings indicate that PA-824 is not likely to affect the PK of CYP3A4-metabolized drugs to a clinically meaningful extent. Most importantly,concomitant use of PA-824 is not expected to produce signiﬁcantdrug interactions with antiretroviral drugs that are substrates ofCYP3A4, such as the protease inhibitors. Overall, single doses oforal midazolam (2 mg) administered alone and then after multiple doses of PA-824 (400 mg daily for 14 days) with a single oraldose of midazolam (2 mg on day 14 of PA-824 dosing) were welltolerated by the subjects in our study.	26408	31462

Rouse,c Diana Severynse-Stevens,c Elliott Pauli,c Daniel EverittbSchool of Pharmacy, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealanda; Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, New York, New York, USAb; RTI International, ResearchTriangle Park, North Carolina, USAcPA-824 is an antitubercular nitroimidazo-oxazine that possesses signiﬁcant activity against replicating and nonreplicating/persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis via a complex mechanism of action distinct from that of any currently marketed drugsfor the treatment of tuberculosis (1, 2). Its mechanism of action isbelieved similar to that of Delamanid, a drug currently under review for market approval by the regulatory authorities (3). PA-824interferes with M. tuberculosis cell wall biosynthesis by inhibitingthe oxidation of hydroxymycolate to ketomycolate. A deazaﬂavin(F420)-dependent nitroreductase has also been identiﬁed whoseactivity in M. tuberculosis cells is involved in PA-824 activationand activity (2). Reduction of PA-824 to its des-nitroimidazolemetabolite by this nitroreductase is associated with generation ofreactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide. PA-824 is activeagainst M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to single or multiple antituberculous drugs and has proven effective in shortening treatment time of drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis in a murine model oftuberculosis (TB) as part of novel drug regimens (4). Moreover,PA-824 was highly active as monotherapy in a 14-day dose rangingearly bactericidal activity (EBA) study in humans where similarefﬁcacy proﬁles were observed across all doses assessed (200 to1,200 mg/day) (5). In EBA studies, the rate of change over time inthe number of M. tuberculosis CFU per ml of sputum in an overnight sputum collection is used to compare different dosing andtreatment regimens. In a follow up study exploring a lower doserange (50 to 200 mg/day), a dose-response trend was detected withdoses 100 mg/day and above showing similar efﬁcacy proﬁles (6).In addition, in a 14-day EBA study of novel antituberculosis drugcombinations, the combination of PA-824 (200 mg/day), moxiﬂoxacin (400 mg/day), and pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg [bodyweight]/day) demonstrated EBA activity comparable to the current World Health Organization-recommended gold standardtherapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (7).Based on the results of these EBA studies, the expected therapeuticAugust 2013 Volume 57 Number 8doses of 100 and 200 mg/day are being evaluated in longer termtrials in patients with pulmonary TB.The current treatment of TB is greatly complicated by the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) co-epidemic. In 2011, 13%of the estimated 8.7 million new cases of TB were coinfected withHIV and, of the 1.4 million deaths from TB, 430,000 deaths wereamong patients who were also HIV positive (8). The treatment ofTB alone requires the use of multiple antibiotics to prevent thedevelopment of drug resistance. The use of multiple antiretroviralagents to treat HIV infection greatly increases the likelihood ofdrug-drug interactions for patients with both infections. Manyimportant drugs used to treat HIV infection, such as the proteaseinhibitors nevirapine, lopinavir, and ritonavir, are substrates ofCYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein and have interactions with drugsfor the treatment of TB, such as rifampin, that are inducers ofhepatic enzymes (9). In vitro data indicate that PA-824 is not aninducer but is a weak substrate and potential weak inhibitor ofCYP3A4 (data not shown). An assessment of PA824’s drug-druginteraction potential is critical to determine its place in future TBtherapy.The present study was designed to ascertain whether PA-824affected the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, a sensitiveprobe substrate and representative compound for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Midazolam is one of the most commonly used invivo and in vitro CYP3A4 probe substrates for drug-drug interaction studies.Received 17 January 2013 Returned for modiﬁcation 1 March 2013Accepted 15 May 2013Published ahead of print 20 May 2013Address correspondence to Daniel Everitt, dan.everitt@tballiance.org.Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

The study followed up on observations in vitro that PA-824 caused weak and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Subjects received a single oral dose ofmidazolam (2 mg), followed by a 2-day washout. After the washout, all subjects received PA-824 (400 mg) once daily for 14 consecutive days. On day 14, all subjects received the ﬁnal PA-824 dose coadministered with a 2-mg oral dose of midazolam. Thepharmacokinetic endpoints AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ؕ, and Cmax for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam were compared betweenmidazolam administered alone versus midazolam coadministered with PA-824. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the meanmidazolam values of Cmax, AUC0 –t, and AUC0 –ؕ parameters were reduced by ca. 16, 15, and 15%, respectively, when PA-824 wascoadministered with midazolam. The total exposure (AUC) of 1-hydroxy midazolam was 13 to 14% greater when coadministered with PA-824 compared to midazolam administered alone. The Cmax of 1-hydroxy midazolam was similar between treatments. Based on these results, PA-824 does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4 to a clinically meaningful extent and is not likely tomarkedly affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 metabolized drugs.	957	6864

After evaporationunder nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analyzed using liquidchromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection according toa validated method proprietary to Covance Laboratories, Inc. The midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam calibration range for quantitation was0.1 to 100 ng/ml. Accuracy ranged from 102.0 to 102.7% and from 102 to103.3% for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam, respectively. Precision(RSD) ranged from 4.5 to 6.3% and from 3.3 to 4.7% for midazolam and1-hydroxy midazolam, respectively.PK analysis. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam plasma PK parameters were calculated for each subject when midazolam was dosedalone and in combination with PA-824 by applying a noncompartmentalapproach using WinNonlin professional version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corp.,Mountain View, CA). The key PK parameters calculated for midazolamand 1-hydroxy midazolam included Cmax (the maximum observed concentration), Tmax (the time at which Cmax occurs), kel (the terminal elimination rate constant), t1/2 (the elimination half-life), AUC0 –t (the areaunder the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval), andAUC0 –ϱ (the area under concentration-time curve extrapolated toinﬁnity).Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) werehandled in the following manner. The lower limit of quantitation formidazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam bioanalysis was 0.1 ng/ml. PK parameters were not calculated for subjects for whom there were insufﬁcientdata. For the calculation of the PK parameters, plasma concentrations thatwere BLQ prior to the ﬁrst quantiﬁable concentration were set to zero, andplasma concentrations BLQ after the ﬁrst quantiﬁable concentration weretreated as missing. For each subject, the elimination rate constant (kel) wasestimated by unweighted log-linear regression using at least three datapoints from the last portion of the plasma concentration proﬁle accordingto the least-squares approach ending with the last concentration prior tothe ﬁrst assay that was below the limit of quantiﬁcation. The eliminationhalf-life (t1/2) was calculated from the kel, using the formula ln(2)/kel. Thekel was not assigned if the terminal elimination phase was not apparent, ifCmax was one of the three last data points, or if the R2 value was Ͻ80%. Incases where the kel interval was not assigned, the values of kel, AUC0 –ϱ,and t1/2 were considered not calculable and were not reported. When theresulting t1/2 was more than half as long as the sampling interval, the kelvalues and associated parameters (t1/2 and AUC0 –ϱ) were not presented.AUCs were calculated by using linear trapezoidal summation from timezero to the speciﬁed time point (either the last available time point or byextrapolation to inﬁnity).Statistical analysis. All descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated in SAS version 9.1.3. Plasma concentration values for midazolam,1-hydroxy midazolam, and PA-824 were listed and summarized usingdescriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics were calculated for PK parameters. The PK endpoints AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ϱ, and Cmax for midazolam and1-hydroxy midazolam were compared between midazolam alone versusmidazolam with PA-824 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.The ANOVA model using SAS PROC mixed procedure included treatment, period, and sequence as ﬁxed effects and subject within sequence asa random effect. For the present study, a potentially clinically importanteffect of PA-824 on midazolam pharmacokinetics, as speciﬁed in the protocol, would be concluded if the 90% conﬁdence interval (CI) for thegeometric mean ratios (GMRs) of AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ϱ, and Cmax were notcontained within the prespeciﬁed “no-effect” 50 to 200% CI limit. If theGMRs were below 50% or above 200%, then a clinically important effectwould be concluded. For the purposes of this study, a clinically importanteffect was considered to be a drug interaction of sufﬁcient magnitude toAntimicrobial Agents and ChemotherapyDownloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on May 14, 2014 by guestStudy design. A phase I study was conducted to evaluate the effects of themultiple-dose administration of PA-824 on the PK of orally administeredmidazolam and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PA-824 whencoadministered with midazolam. The study was an open-label, multidose,ﬁxed-sequence design performed in keeping with the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration’s industry guidance (10). The clinical study was conducted by Celerion, Inc. (formerly MDS Pharma Services, Inc.), in Lincoln, NE, under the sponsorship of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.Subjects were enrolled into the study and housed in the clinical facilityfrom the evening of day 1 (at least 15 h before dosing) through the morning of day 18. The total study duration for each subject from check-inthrough study termination (including a 2-day washout) spanned 18nights and 19 days, with follow-up evaluation over 3 months.All subjects received an initial single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolamCIV hydrochloride syrup (Boehringer Ingelheim/Roxane Laboratories)administered with 240 ml of water, followed by a 2-day washout. After thewashout, all subjects received 400 mg of PA-824 (two 200-mg tablets)administered with 240 ml of water once daily for 14 consecutive days. Onthe day 14 of PA-824 dosing, a single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolam wascoadministered with 400 mg of PA-824 with 240 ml of water. Subjectsfasted for a minimum of 8 h prior to and 4 h after dosing. Water waspermitted ad libitum 1 h prior to and then again 1 h after dosing. Subjectsremained in an upright position (seated or standing) for 4 h after dosing.Dietary restrictions included caffeine, alcohol, poppy seeds, and grapefruit products prior to and throughout the study. No medication waspermitted without sponsor approval except acetaminophen.Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were included ifthey were healthy nonsmokers aged 19 to 50, with a body mass index of 18to 29, inclusive, with negative tests for alcohol and drugs of abuse. Subjectswere excluded if they had any clinically signiﬁcant history or presence of acardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal,endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurologic disease/disorder.Subjects also were excluded if they had a psychological, psychiatric, ormetabolic disorder (including eating disorders) or if they had experiencedany acute illness within 4 weeks. Female subjects were excluded if theywere pregnant (positive test for serum human chorionic gonadotropin atscreening or check-in), breast feeding, or planning to conceive a childwithin 30 days of cessation of treatment. Male subjects were excluded ifthey were planning to father a child within 12 weeks of cessation of treatment. Finally, subjects were excluded if they had a lens opacity or evidenceof lens opacity on slit-lamp ophthalmologic examination to follow up onﬁndings that some rats developed cataracts in toxicology studies at highdoses over 3 to 6 months of dosing.All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participationin the study. Study protocols and consent forms were reviewed and approved by Celerion’s Institutional Review Board, and the study was conducted in accordance with U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Parts50, 56, and 312) principles and requirements and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines (ICH E6).Sampling. PK blood samples for midazolam (obtained once, 6 ml)were collected prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and24 h after each 2-mg oral dose of midazolam. PK blood samples for PA824 (obtained once, 6 ml) were collected predose on days 12 and 13 ofconsecutive PA-824 dosing and predose on the day 14 prior to coadministration.Bioanalytical methods. Blood samples were collected and centrifuged, and plasma was separated and stored at Ϫ20°C. Plasma sampleswere analyzed for PA-824, midazolam, and the midazolam metabolite1-hydroxy midazolam using separately validated liquid chromatographymass spectrometry methods developed at Covance Laboratories, Inc.PA-824 and the internal standard, triazolam (added during sampleprocessing), were extracted from human plasma samples using liquidliquid extraction.

These data should be interpreted with caution, because the drop-out rate in extensions was high and differedbetween treatment groups.In a previous submission (25 Jun 2009), the applicant had stated that there were twoliraglutide-treated patients (both treated with 1.8 mg/day) who began with a serumcalcitonin <50 ng/L and shifted to >50 ng/L during study, and one comparator-treatedpatient. In the 26 Oct 2009, submission, the applicant states that there was only oneliraglutide-treated patient (1.8 mg group) who exhibited this shift, and no comparator-treated patients. The 26 Oct 2009 submission did not discuss this discrepancy. Inresponse (1 1 Nov 2009) to an inquiry regarding the difference, the applicant stated thatthe 25 Jun 2009 submission ?contained an error?.Data provided for Weeks 52 and 104 should be interpreted with caution; most data at 52weeks, and all data at 104 weeks, are from voluntary unblinded extensions. The drop-outrate in extensions was high, and differed between treatment groups, as discussed in theoriginal clinical safety review (DARRTS 8 Aug 2009). The applicant has not submittedstudy reports for the diabetes trial versus exenatide and for the Phase 2 obesity trial, and-therefore these data_are preliminary. As in previous submissions, the mean and medianchanges in serum calcitonin are not large. Also as in previous submissions, the highestpercentage of upward shifters occurs in the 1.8 mg liraglutide dose group, which is thehighest proposed dose for marketing.As discussed in the original clinical safety review, the clinical safety reviewer remainsconcerned about the strong animal carcinogenicity signal for liraglutide, and feels that theduration of blinded controlled human study has been inadequate to recommend marketingat this time. The clinical reviewer continues to recommend a long-term year) double-blinded controlled study, which would include multiple biomarkers to furthercharacterize liraglutide?s effect on C-cells, prior to marketing.	4127	7326

Alternatively, the Sponsor canconduct a designated clinical trial to assess adverse events associated with immunogenicity.While antibody levels may be obtained on a subset of patients from the proposed large Phase IVtrial, we recommend sampling subjects following a liraglutide-free period of uniform andsuf?cient duration. This may necessitate periodic drug-withholding periods within the trialdesign in order to screen for ADA with maximal sensitivity. In addition, outcome measures inthis trial should also include assessments relevant to the potential immunopathogenicmechanisms of ADA, not only in tenns of reduced drug efficacy, but also in terms of organ-speci?c adverse events common to drug hypersensitivity reactions. BackgroundDrug Product. Liragltitide is an analogue of human glucagon-like-peptide-I (GLP-I), which iscurrently under review (NDA 22341; Sponsor: Novo Nordisk) for approval as a subcutaneouslyinjected, once daily treatment for diabetes mellitus type 2. Native GLP-1 is a gut incretinhormone that induces glucose-dependent insulin secretion but has an extremely short half?life,due to rapid degradation by endogenous dipeptidy1?peptidase-4. As an analogue to GLP-1,liraglutide has an altered structure, which makes it more resistant to degradation, resulting in alonger half-life. As the insulin?secreting activity of liraglutide is glucose-dependent, the drug isdesigned to facilitate glycemic control with a decreasedrisk of hypoglycemia due to insulinover?secretion, as compared to other insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylurea drugs.Anti?drug Antibody Formation. A review of the information submitted by the Sponsor for NDA 22341 reveals that anti?drug antibodies (ADA) to liraglutide developed in nearly 10% ofstudy drug recipients in four major Phase clinical trials (Trials 1572, 1436, 1574, and 1697).Of these, approximately half displayed cross-reactivity with native GLP-1 of?liraglutide recipients tested), while roughly 10% (or 1-2% of the total sample) developedantibodies with neutralizing activity against liraglutide. In contrast to these liraglutide-speci?cADA, antibodies formed against another GLP-1 analogue, exenatide (the only FDA-approveddrug product in this class: NDA 21773), demonstrated no signi?cant treatment-emergent cross-reactivity with either or glucagon. Liraglutide-speci?c ADA were detected using aradioimmune assay in which patient serum was adsorbed with radiolabeled liraglutide and thenprotein-extracted with polyethylene glycol. In turn, the amount of precipitated radioactivity liraglutide bound?antibody) was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of radioactivityapplied to the sample and could be used to quantify the level of ADA present in the sample.Assessment of cross-reactivity was done by taking patient serum bound with radiolabeledliraglutide and subsequently incubating it with excess unlabeled native protein todetermine the extent to which GLP-1 competed off bound, radiolabeled liraglutide. Neutralizingactivity of ADA was assessed using a cell-based assay in which a luciferase reporter geneconstruct was created using the human receptor andtransfected into a rodent cell line.This construct allowed for the quanti?cation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in	9891	13629

Thus, by incubating patientserum with a known amount of liraglutide prior to application to the cell line, the neutralizingactivity of ADA could be measured as a function of their inhibitory activity against liraglutide-induced production.-Antibody Detection Assays and Efficacy Assessment. A primary concem with the assaysdescribed above is that the ADA detection assay is directly inhibited by the presence of drugproduct in patient serum. In other words, sensitivity of the detection assay is markedlydiminished if sampling is done while levels of liraglutide are still detectable in the circulation,potentially resulting in false negative results. To address this concern, immunogenicity samplestested in the four Phase trials were drawn :5 days following the last liraglutide dose. Of note,however, nonclinical animal studies in cynomolgus monkeys suggested ADA may interfere withliraglutide clearance and result in prolonged drug exposure. Thus, it is unclear whether a 5-daydrug-free window is adequate to minimize misclassi?cation bias in terms of ADA detection.With regard to drug efficacy, the treatment effects of ADA formation, GLP-1 cross-reactivity,and neutralizing antibody formation on glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbAlc, long?termglycemic control) were evaluated in separate AN COVA models and found to have no statisticalimpact. Interestingly, mean HgbAlc levels were actually lower in the small group of patientswith detectable neutralizing ADA However, properly timed samples were not universallyavailable for all subjects in these studies. Moreover, the number of liraglutide-recipientsevaluated in the HgbA1 efficacy analysis (n=1174; ADA?positive=101) was lower than the totalnumber of liraglutide-recipients included in ADA detection studies (n=250l; ADA-positive=160). Thus, the immunogenicity dataset gleaned from the Phase trials appearsincomplete. Moreover, a propensity for false negative misclassi?cation in this dataset withregard to ADA detection would result in regression toward the mean in group values, potentiallymasking the impact of ADA on long-term drug effectiveness.Safety Assessment. Although no serious adverse events emerged in relation to ADA formation,a comparison of adverse event pro?les between subjects who developed anti?liraglutide antibodies versus seronegative patients revealed trends toward an increased incidence in severalcategories of adverse events in the ADA-positive group, including infections (especially of theupper and lower respiratory tract), injection site reactions, and musculoskeletal disorders (eg,arthralgias). Again, false negative misclassi?cations would tend to regress these group valuestoward the mean and obscure actual underlying differences in adverse event rates associated withADA formation. Thus, although there does not appear to be a significant safety signal amongsubjects who developed ADA, it remains concerning that over half of them displayed cross-reactivity to native . and that the assays used for ADA detection have questionableaccuracy, particularly at only 5 days following last study drug administration.RecommendationsDMEP requests input from our Division regarding the potential impact of ADA on the approvalof liraglutide and whether any additional studies should be required of the Sponsor to furtherexplore safety and/or clinical efficacy issues of this drug, with respect to imrnunogenicity.	13630	17097
32	1	2	16	1	9	 _/I/0/r/257% Given concerns over the accuracy of the ADA detection assay used, particularly as it relates todecreased sensitivity in the presence of circulating study drug, as well as the incomplete natureof the Phase clinical trial immunogenicity dataset as re?ected in both partial testing and apropensity for false negative misclassification, we recommend conducting a postmarketing trialof liraglutide recipients to more reliably delineate the incidence and implications of liraglutide-speci?c ADA fonnation. At present, the Sponsor plans to conduct a randomized, blinded,placebo-controlled postmarketing trial of 9000 type 2 diabetic patients at risk for cardiovascularcomplications, in order to discern the impact of study drug on cardiovascular related mortalityand morbidity. Clinical immunogenicity could be evaluated in a subset of liraglutide recipients inthis large Phase IV trial. Altematively, potential adverse events associated with immunogenicitycould be assessed in a separate postmarketing trial.We note that antibody sampling in the Phase trials after a 5-day drug-free period was onlydone after 6 months on study drug, while ADA formation against a similar drug product,exenatide, peaked at 6 weeks following drug initiation. Thus, assessing for antibody formationat more than one time point in the proposed study, including timepoints earlier than 6 months,would provide information on the kinetics of ADA formation. However, immunogenicitysampling must be suf?ciently separated in time from last study drug receipt, as supported by theSponsor?s pharmacokinetic data. Given that liraglutide is administered as a once daily injection,this may necessitate recurrent periods of drug withholding at pre-planned points in the study, inorder to draw immunogenicity samples only after a suf?cient drug-free period, after which, studydrug may be re?started for the purposes of completing the long-term cardiovascular outcomesstudy. A planned and uniformly executed immunogenicity evaluation would allow the Sponsorto robustly determine the effects of ADA formation on both the ef?cacy and safety pro?le ofliraglutide, as such a study would capture immunogenicity data on the full dataset.As mentioned in the Clinical Safety Review of NDA 22341, the DMEP Clinical Review Teamalready recommended that an assessment of immune-related adverse events also be done for theentire sample of the proposed cardiovascular outcomes postmarketing study, with which weconcur. To facilitate correlation of observed immune-related adverse events to seroconversion,antibody levels could be obtained from a subset of patients in this trial. The number of patientssampled should take into account the overall rate of seroconversion as well as the ratesof seroconversion for neutralizing antibodies and cross-reactive antibodies observed in the Phase clinical development program..Although no major safety signals emerged in this dataset related to IgE-mediated immediatehypersensitivity events other than urticaria, -ADA formation with documented cross-reactivity toan endogenous protein carries a potential risk not only of inactivation of the native protein, butalso of antigen?antibody complex mediated disease, including immune complex deposition,serum sickness, or other systemic hypersensitivity Thus, outcome measures in thispostmarketing immunogenicity study should also address these immune mechanisms, includingappropriate historical and physical assessments of target body systems cutaneous andmusculoskeletal manifestations), measuring complement levels as an index of immune complexmediated disease, and screening hepatic transaminases and renal function tests in the setting ofsystemic in?ammatory ?ndings.	17098	20813

On 12 Aug 2009, the applicant submittedthe requested information. Patient 212002 was a 45 year old woman who had a nonserious event of ?jaundice?reported after 98 days of treatment with liraglutide. No further clinical history wasavailable. However, the applicant provided laboratory data which suggests that this eventwas not clinically significant and may not have represented actual jaundice. Prior to theevent, the patient had three separate sets of normal laboratory for serum alanineaminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin, including normal values 4days prior to the reported date of the event. At that time, her bilirubin was 0.16 mg/dL(upper limit of normal 1.28). Subsequent to the date of the event of ?jaundice?, allbilirubin levels and transaminase levels were normal on all seven subsequent collectionsover an additional 20 months. The closest post?event values were from samples collected3 months after the event; there is a small possibility that the patient had an event ofjaundice that rapidly resolved. However, liraglutide had not been discontinued, anddespite its continued use for 20 months, multiple subsequent measures of liver functionwere normal, suggesting that liraglutide was not causative in a signi?cant liver injury.	21153	22752

(liraglutide)1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis document contains the clinical ef?cacy review for liraglutide, a human glucagon-likepeptide (GLP-1) analogue that has been developed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improveglycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The clinical safety review forliraglutide is contained in a separate document prepared by Dr. Karen Mahoney.1.1 Recommendation on Regulatory ActionThe recommendation for regulatory action in this review is based on a clinical review of efficacyonly. Safety is addressed by Dr. Mahoney in her Clinical Review of Safety. For acomprehensive risk/bene?t analysis that incorporates all known efficacy and safety informationthe reader is referred to the cross discipline team leader memo written by Dr. Joffe.Based on my review of clinical efficacy, 1 recommend approval of liraglutide from a clinicalefficacy perspective for the Sponsor?s proposed indication and at the doses proposed by theSponsor. There is substantial evidence of effectiveness from ?ve pivotal phase 3 trials(randomized, double?blind, and controlled (some placebo?controlled and some active-controlled)) that are considered by this reviewer to be ?adequate and well-controlled? and permitselection of an appropriate dosing regimen for the claimed indication in the general type 2diabetic population as well as in special populations including various demographic subgroups,and those with renal or hepatic impairment.1.2 Recommendation on Postmarketing ActionsFrom an efficacy standpoint there are no recommendations on postmarketing actions. Theefficacy of liraglutide has been well-established in the premarketing development program.1.2.1 Risk Management ActivityPlease see Dr. Mahoney?s clinical safety review1.2.2 Required Phase 4 CommitmentsRequired phase 4 commitments, if any, are discussed in Dr. Mahoney?s clinical safety review.5	28639	30588

(liraglutide)1.2.3 Other Phase 4 RequestsNone1.3 Summary of Clinical Findings1.3.1 Brief Overview of Clinical ProgramLiraglutide (proposed trade name Victo2:a?) is a new molecular entity in the class of drugsknown as glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogues that has been developed as an adjunct to dietand exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Liraglutide isadministered by subcutaneous injection. The clinical ef?cacy of liraglutide was studied in adult(age 2 18 years) type 2 diabetic patients in ?ve pivotal phase 3 trials. A total of 3978 patientswere exposed to treatment in the phase 3 efficacy trials (2501 to liraglutide, 524 to placebo, and953 to an active comparator). The overall number of patients in the safety database and extent ofexposure are discussed in Dr. Mahoney?s clinical safety review.1.3.2 Efficacy -The five major efficacy trials investigated the bene?ts of liraglutide as:Monotherapy liraglutide alone) (52 week trial)Add-on to one oral anti-diabetic drug (two 26 week trials)0 combination with metformin0 combination with a sulfonylurea (glimepiride)Add-on to two oral anti-diabetic drugs (two 26 week trials)0 combination with a thiazolidinedione (TZD) (rosiglitazone) and metformin0 combination with an sulfonylurea (glimepiride) and metforminThe three above-listed scenarios, monotherapy liraglutide alone), ?add-on? to one oral anti-diabetic drug combined with one other commonly used anti-diabetic drug), and ?add-on? totwo oral anti-diabetic drugs combined with two other commonly used anti-diabetic drugs)represent the manner in which liraglutide will be used in the diabetic population because diabetesis a progressive disease that typically requires the stepwise addition of anti-diabetic agents (andultimately insulin) to maintain adequate glycemic control. Therefore, this development programhas adequately studied liraglutide in a large proportion of the potential conditions of its use bydiabetic patients.	30589	32648

HbAlcis an appropriate endpoint for reasons discussed in section The FDA draft guidanceentitled Guidance for Industry, Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologicsfor Treatment and Preventioncm071624.pdf) states, ?For purposes of drug approval and labeling, ?nal demonstration ofef?cacy should be based on reduction in HbAlc HbAlc is the primary endpoint of choice,albeit a surrogate), which will support an indication of glycemic control.? .Important secondary endpoints included other glycemic control parameters such as change infasting plasma glucose at the end of the double?blind treatment period, as well as body weightchange at the end of the double?blind treatment period.The development program used both placebo and active comparators (meaning another anti-diabetic drug) for control groups in the phase 3 clinical trials. The monotherapy trial did nothave a placebo group, but rather compared liraglutide with glimepiride, a commonly usedsulfonylurea drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The add-on trials used various activecomparators" that consisted of commonly used anti-diabetic therapies, mostly oral, but alsoinsulin glargine in one trial. The active comparators dosages generally were adequate forsupporting approval of liraglutide for the proposed indication. The full discussion of theadequacy of active comparator dosages is located in section 6 of this review.Blinding was accomplished in all of the phase 3 trials (note exception below) by incorporating aplacebo and/or a double-dummy technique in which active comparators were also blinded by theuse of indistinguishable ?dummy? comparators. (exception: the trial that compared liraglutide toinsulin glargine included open-label insulin glargine because of the need for titration of insulin).Conduct of the studies was appropriate with adherence to good clinical practices and fullfinancial disclosures reported. Statistical analyses were appropriately performed; these arediscussed more fully in the statistical review written by the Division of Biometrics.This reviewer concludes that liraglutide is effective for the proposed indication: as an adjunct todiet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thisconclusion is based both on the quality of the phase 3 clinical trials conducted, as discussed inthe previous paragraphs in this section, as well as the clinical importance of the ?ndings of thosetrials. Based on the results of the trials, it can be concluded that liraglutide results in a clinicallyimportant placebo-corrected reduction in HbAlc of approximately 1% when used asmonotherapy, as add-on to one other oral anti-diabetic agent, or as add-on to two other oral anti-diabetic agents. This reviewer did not identify any major limitations of the available clinical data	32649	35993

These analyses did not suggest that there were any subsets of the populationthat demonstrated differences with respect to the effectiveness, as measured by HbA1c, amongtreatments. Therefore, from an ef?cacy standpoint, there were no meaningful differences inef?cacy across these demographic variables that would affect this product?s use.Renal and Hepatic ImpairmentBased on clinical pharmacology data (including one pharmacokinetic study in patients with renalimpairment and one pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatic impairment) no doseadjustment is proposed for renal and hepatic impairment subjects (see section 5.1). The clinicalpharmacology reviewer concluded the same. The clinical ef?cacy review of the phase 3program also did not find evidence that dose adjustment should be recommended for patientswith mild renal and hepatic impairment. However, the phase 3 trials did not enroll many subjectswith moderate or severely impaired renal and hepatic function so there is limited ef?cacy data inthese populations.Pregnancy and LactationThe use of liraglutide during pregnancy and lactation is primarily a safety issue.

(liraglutide)2 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND2.1 Product InformationProduct descriptionLiraglutide is a once-dailyhuman GLP-1 analogue in which lysine at position 34 has been replaced with arginine, andpalmitic acid has been attached via a glutamoyl spacer to lysine at position 26.Established name and proposed trade nameThe established name of this product is liraglutide. The proposed trade name is Victoza?. Thistrade name has been approved by the Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis(DMEPA).Chemical classLiraglutide is a new molecular entity.Pharmacologic classLiraglutide belongs to the class of anti-diabetic agents known as glucagon-like peptide-l (GLP-l) analogues. Liraglutide is the second GLP-1 analogue to undergo FDA review as a New DrugApplication (NDA). The other GLP-1 analogue, exenatide (trade name Byetta?) was approvedas a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus in April, 2005 and is dosed subcutaneously twicedaily. A once weekly formulation of exenatide (exenatide LAR) is currently under review by theDivision of Metabolism and Endocrinologic Products (DMEP).Discussion of the pharmacologic class (source: sponsor?s clinical overview)Oral glucose leads to greater insulin secretion than intravenous glucose despite equivalentincreases in plasma glucose levels. This phenomenon, known as the incretin effect, is caused bygastrointestinal hormones released from the small intestine during a meal that stimulate insulinrelease from the pancreatic beta?cell in a glucose-dependent manner. GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide formerly known as gastric inhibitory peptide) are thetwo most important incretin hormones.Studies with native GLP-1 have shown ?that the primary mechanisms of action are to:- stimulate insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion in a physiological and glucosedependent manner- delay gastric emptying- reduce appetite10	40276	42248
46	1	2	16	1	23	Clinical ReviewLisa B. Yanoff, M.D.NDA 22,341 (Submission 000)Victoza? (liraglutide)An important and possibly primary defect in type 2 diabetes may be an impaired incretinfunction. Patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced levels and a well-preserved insulinresponse to GLP-1. In contrast, patients with type 2 diabetes have normal or increasedGIP levels, but an impaired insulin response to GIP. These properties make GLP-1 a suitablecandidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, due to the very short half-life of nativeGLP-I <1.5 minutes after i.v. administration) and short duration of action, the nativehormone is not a useful therapeutic agent. The short half-life is due to rapid degradation bydipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). Therefore, GLP-I analogues with a longer half-life are thetarget of drug development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Applicant?s proposed indication, dosing regimen, age groupThe sponsor proposes liraglutide as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic controin adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The reader should be aware that DMEP is no longer issuing separate indications for speci?ccombinations of drugs and biologics for the? treatment of type 2 diabetes. The indication sectionin labeling is instead has been replaced by a single, simpli?ed indication (Drug is indicated asan adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetesmellitus). If the risk/bene?t pro?le is favorable when the drug is used in combination with otherdrugs, the study ?ndings and conclusions will be described in the Clinical Studies section of thelabel, effectively providing support for the combination use in clinical practice. If the drug is notstudied in combination with medications that are likely to be commonly co-administered with it in clinical practice, DMEP will require that the label contain a statementreflecting this limitation under ?Important Limitations of Use?.The applicant?s proposed dosing regimen is as follows:For all patients liraglutide treatment should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg injectedsubcutaneously for at least one week, after which the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. Basedon clinical response and after at least one week at 1.2 mg, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg toachieve maximum efficacy.2.2 Currently Available Treatment for IndicationT2DM can be treated with a combination of proper diet, exercise, and the following classes ofdrugs, alone or in combination:0 Insulin and insulin analogues0 Sulfonylureas0 Biguanides0 MeglitinidesThiazolidinediones (TZDS)Inhibitors of alpha-glucosidaseAnalogues of Glucagon-like Peptide analogues of human amylinll	42249	44942

(liraglutide)0 Inhibitors of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 40 Bile acid sequestrants 0 Dopamine agonistsDespite the number of drugs available for the treatment of T2DM, a substantial proportion ofpatients either remain under poor glycemic control or experience deterioration of glycemiccontrol after an initial period of successful treatment with an antidiabetic drug. Further, many ofthesedrug classes have limited usefulness in certain populations. For example, metfonnin is notfor use in patients with renal insuf?ciency and TZDs are not for use in many patients withcongestive heart failure. Insulin and insulin analogues as well as sulfonylureas are oftenassociated with hypoglycemia and weight gain. For these reasons, there is an unmet need fornew antidiabetic therapies.	44943	45793
550	1	4	42	1	1	A Randomized Comparison of TranscervicalFoley Catheter to Intravaginal Misoprostol forPreinduction Cervical RipeningANTHONY C. SCISCIONE, DO, LISA NGUYEN, MD, JAMES MANLEY, MD,MARJORIE POLLOCK, MSN, CRNP, BRIDGET MAAS, BSN, RNC, ANDGARRETT COLMORGEN, MDObjective: To compare the efﬁcacy of intravaginal misoprostol tablets with transcervical Foley catheter for preinductioncervical ripening.Methods: Pregnant women who presented for induction oflabor with unfavorable cervices (Bishop score less than 6)were assigned randomly to intravaginal misoprostol (50 ␮gtablet every 4 hours for a maximum of six doses) or 30-mLFoley catheter placed transcervically with maintenance oftraction.Results: Among 111 women, 53 were allocated to misoprostol and 58 to Foley bulb. Contractile abnormalities weremore frequent in the misoprostol group (20.4%) than theFoley group (0%) (P < .001). No statistically signiﬁcantdifferences were noted between groups in change in Bishopscore, preinduction cervical ripening times, and total induction times. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differencesin mode of delivery or adverse neonatal outcomes. Uterinerupture occurred in one woman with two previous cesareandeliveries in the misoprostol group.Conclusion: Intravaginal misoprostol and transcervicalFoley catheter are equivalent for cervical ripening. Uterinecontractile abnormalities and meconium passage are morecommon with misoprostol. (Obstet Gynecol 2001;97:603–7.© 2001 by The American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists.)Women who require labor induction often present withunfavorable cervices, which can lead to a prolongedand difﬁcult induction. Preinduction cervical ripening isoften done to increase the likelihood of successful laborinduction.1–3 More than 15% of pregnant women havepreinduction cervical ripening and labor induction,4 sothere is keen interest in developing safer, more cost-From the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Christiana CareHealth Services, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division, Newark, Delaware.VOL. 97, NO. 4, APRIL 2001effective, and more efﬁcient means of preinductionripening.Embrey and Mollison5 ﬁrst described using a transcervical Foley catheter for cervical ripening. Obed andAdewole6 documented its effectiveness by increasingBishop scores in women with unripe cervices. Sincethen, two studies found transcervical Foley catheters aseffective as various prostaglandin (PG) preparations forripening.7,8 In a larger, randomized trial, we found thatthe Foley catheter was more effective and more economical than PGE2 gel (Prepidil; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI)for providing preinduction ripening.9Misoprostol (Cytotec, Searle Pharmaceuticals, Chicago, IL) is a PGE1 analog, which is indicated forprevention of gastric ulcers in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Margulies et al10 suggested that the drug might be effective for induction oflabor, so there has been great interest in the safety andefﬁcacy of misoprostol, especially compared with PGE2agents for preinduction ripening. Multiple studies documented clinical advantages and cost beneﬁts of intravaginal misoprostol compared with PGE2 preparationsfor cervical ripening and induction of labor.4 However,some reports found a high rate of uterine contractileabnormalities.11,12We report the ﬁndings of a trial in which we compared efﬁcacy of misoprostol to transcervical Foleycatheter for preinduction cervical ripening.Materials and MethodsAfter approval from the institutional review board atChristiana Care Health Services, the study was conducted from July 1, 1997, to July 1, 1999.

Women referredfrom outside hospitals who met entrance criteria andwere being delivered at Christiana hospital also wereoffered entry. Inclusion criteria included singleton gestations in vertex presentation at greater than 28 weeks’gestation. Women were monitored for at least 1 hourand had reactive nonstress tests without decelerations,and fewer than six contractions per hour. Each womanhad a Bishop score assigned by her attending physicianor an obstetrics and gynecology resident. Most of thetime the person who assigned Bishop scores was theperson doing preinduction cervical ripening and subsequent cervical examinations. Bishop score less than 6was necessary for entry.Exclusion criteria included rupture of membranes,antepartum bleeding, active genital herpes infection,fetal death, placenta previa, previous induction or preinduction agent during the pregnancy, and knownallergy to misoprostol. Women with histories of cesarean deliveries were not excluded.During computer-generated random allocation,methods of preinduction cervical ripening were placedconsecutively in opaque envelopes by a research nurseand sealed. After written consent was obtained, eachwoman was assigned to receive cervical ripening with atranscervical Foley catheter or misoprostol, by selectionof the next consecutive envelope.All women who presented for induction had routineadmission laboratory studies, (complete blood countand a type and screen) an intravenous (IV) infusionstarted, and continuous fetal heart rate monitoring andcontraction monitoring before randomization. Only IVoxytocin could be used for labor induction after completion of the protocol for preinduction cervical ripening. No uniform guidelines for oxytocin were enforced,but almost all physicians used our hospital’s policy forit; beginning at 1 mIU and increasing 1 mIU every 15minutes. Women who had spontaneous labor during orafter preinduction ripening did not receive oxytocinunless a labor abnormality was diagnosed. Artiﬁcialrupture of membranes was done as soon as clinicallyfeasible in both groups.After meeting entrance criteria, a 16F Foley catheterwith a 30-mL balloon was inserted into the endocervicalcanal under direct visualization during a sterile speculum examination for women assigned to transcervicalFoley catheters. Cleansing or sterilization of the vaginaor cervix was not done; however, every effort was madeto avoid contact with the vagina or ectocervix with thecatheter. The catheter was advanced into the endocervical canal. Once past the internal os, 30 mL of sterile604 Sciscione et alPreinduction Cervical Ripeningwater was injected into the balloon. Traction was applied by taping the end of the catheter to the medial sideof the woman’s knee or thigh. The catheter was checkedfor extrusion of the balloon from the cervix every 6hours by cervical examination. If the balloon had notbeen extruded, the catheter was adjusted to continuegentle traction. Each subject had external fetal monitoring for reactive nonstress tests after Foley catheterplacement. Then she was allowed to ambulate withintermittent fetal heart rate (FHR) assessment every 30minutes. Continuous external fetal monitoring wasdone every 2 hours for a reactive nonstress test or untilregular, strong contractions ensued. There was no predicted time limit for the Foley catheter to be extruded.Once the catheter was extruded from the cervix, IVoxytocin was begun.The group assigned misoprostol had 50 ␮g of misoprostol (Cytotec, Searle Pharmaceuticals, Chicago, IL)placed intravaginally. Because 50-␮g tablets were notavailable, a 100-␮g tablet was cut in half by the pharmacist, using a pill cutter. A 50-␮g half tablet wasplaced in the posterior fornix of the vagina every 4hours for a maximum of six doses. Women in thatgroup had continuous external fetal monitoring. Subsequent doses were held if labor ensued or if uterinetachysystole, nonreassuring FHR, or rupture of membranes occurred. Oxytocin was begun 4 hours after thelast dose of misoprostol in women who did not havespontaneous labor (regular contractions with continuedcervical change), but had Bishop scores over 5, or ifwomen had received six doses of misoprostol.Our intent was to evaluate the success of preinduction cervical ripening, so the primary outcome measurewas change in Bishop score. For women in the Foleycatheter group, that was deﬁned as the difference between initial cervical examination and examination atthe time of extrusion. In the misoprostol group, it wasthe difference between initial examination and Bishopscore assigned with the last dose of misoprostol. Todetect a change of at least 1 in the Bishop score andmaintain 80% power, with an alpha error of 0.05, usinga variance of 3.96 from our previous trial,9 50 womenwere needed in each group. Despite needing fewerwomen to ﬁnd a larger difference in Bishop scorechange, we felt that a difference of 1 was the least thatwould be clinically important.Secondary outcome measures included length of timefor preinduction cervical ripening (time from placementof preinduction method until extrusion of Foley catheter, or 1 hour after the last dose of misoprostol), totaltime for induction (time of placement of ripening agentuntil delivery), delivery route, uterine tachysystole (deﬁned as six contractions in 10 minutes, in two consecutive 10-minute periods), side effects, subject comfort,Obstetrics & Gynecology	3712	9318

That left 111eligible subjects, 58 of whom were assigned to cathetersand 53 to misoprostol. Indications for induction of laborare presented in Table 1. Groups were similar in maternal age, gestational age at inclusion, gravidity, nulliparity, and Bishop score at entry (Table 2).Initially, women with histories of cesarean deliverieswere included in the trial.

Twenty-one subjects (39.6%) in the misoprostolgroup did not require oxytocin because of spontaneouslabor after misoprostol administration. No Foley catheter needed to be replaced after initial insertion and nopatients had spontaneous labor in that group. Maternalside effects were infrequent. The most frequent complaint in the Foley group was mild discomfort atinsertion. However, the amount of discomfort was mildto moderate in both groups, with the misoprostol groupat a median discomfort level of 5.0 and the Foley groupat a mean discomfort level of 4.0 (P ϭ .87).

There was no difference in preinductioncervical ripening time or total time from the beginningof preinduction cervical ripening to delivery (Table 3).Also there was no difference in number of vaginaldeliveries or total deliveries within 24 hours in eachgroup (Table 4).

The number of cesarean deliveries fornonreassuring fetal testing was higher in the misoprostol group, but the difference was not statistically significant (12% versus 24%; P ϭ .09). However, there was astatistically signiﬁcant increase in meconium passage inthe misoprostol group. Mode of delivery and Bishopscore change, were not signiﬁcantly different betweennulliparous women and multiparous women betweengroups.Misoprostol-treated women were statistically morelikely to have uterine contractile abnormalities andmeconium passage (Table 4). Two women in the misoprostol group had nonreassuring FHR patterns associated with uterine contractile abnormalities (hyperstimulation syndrome) that necessitated cesareandeliveries. Both were treated with IV terbutaline todiminish uterine hypertonus without clinical effect.Both infants did well, despite one being depressed atdelivery.DiscussionWe found that a pharmacologic method of cervicalripening, misoprostol, and a mechanical method, theFoley catheter, were similarly effective and timely.However, signiﬁcantly higher rates of uterine tachysystole and meconium passage were found in the misoprostol group. There were two cases of uterine hyperstimulation syndrome in the misoprostol group, both ofwhich required immediate cesarean delivery.All pharmacologic methods of cervical ripening havebeen associated with uterine contractile abnormalities.Misoprostol is no exception.11 The rate of uterine contractile abnormalities has varied between 7.1 and36.7%.4 The Foley catheter has been associated with rareuterine contraction abnormalities.7 In our previous trial,we reported a rate of 11.8%,9 partially caused by ourliberal deﬁnition of hyperstimulation (six contractionsin 10 minutes), and the technique for placement of theFoley bulb in that trial. All cases of hyperstimulation inour previous report were transient and shortly afterplacement of the catheter, and did not produce FHRabnormalities. In the current study we used a smallerFoley catheter, abandoned the obturator to help placethe catheter, and no longer permitted a tenaculum tohold the cervix. No cases of hyperstimulation (using amore strict deﬁnition) or FHR abnormalities were notedin the Foley catheter arm in this trial. We were able toplace all Foley catheters without an obturator or atenaculum without difﬁculty.We believe that methods that quantitate frequency ofcontractions are important for documentation and communication, but have little clinical value. Uterine contractile abnormalities are common in laboring women606 Sciscione et alPreinduction Cervical Ripeningand often attract little attention until they begin toadversely affect fetuses. We believe that the most compelling and clinically useful deﬁnition is a uterinecontraction abnormality that causes a nonreassuringFHR, which has been called hyperstimulation syndrome.12 In this trial and other reports, hyperstimulation syndrome was not associated with Foley catheteralone for ripening.7 In a recent review of the literature, the relative risk (RR) of hyperstimulation syndrome was 1.45 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.04, 2.04)with misoprostol,14 which might decrease with lowerdosages.4In a report by Perry et al,15 a Foley catheter withdinoprostone gel was compared with 25 ␮g of intravaginal misoprostol every 4 hours, and there was signiﬁcant reduction in time to vaginal delivery and signiﬁcantly more women delivered within 24 hours in theFoley-dinoprostone group. Although not statisticallysigniﬁcant, the Foley-dinoprostone group had a lowerfrequency of hyperstimulation syndrome (3% versus11%; P ϭ .091). There are several signiﬁcant differencesbetween our trial and the report by Perry et al. The ﬁrstand most obvious is the addition of dinoprostone gel tothe Foley catheter; second is the larger balloon used intheir trial (50 mL versus 30 mL); last is the smaller doseof misoprostol (25 ␮g versus 50 ␮g). Whether timeadvantages in the Perry et al trial were caused byaddition of dinoprostone gel, the larger balloon, thesmaller dose of misoprostol, or all three, is unclear.In a report by Abramovici et al,16 oral misoprostol at50 ␮g every 4 hours to a maximum of 300 ␮g wascompared with Foley catheter placement with concomitant IV oxytocin. In our trial we found no difference inmultiparous or nulliparous delivery within 24 hours,but they found a signiﬁcantly higher percentage ofmultiparous women who delivered within 24 hours andshorter induction times in the Foley catheter and oxytocin group. Unfortunately, they also found a very highrate of uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (13%) in theFoley and oxytocin group. However, there were nodifferences in rate of cesarean delivery or neonataloutcomes.Intravaginal misoprostol dosages have ranged from25-, 50-, or 100-␮g tablets every 4 – 6 hours to maximumdoses as high as 800 ␮g.4 The 50-␮g dosing appears tobe associated with a signiﬁcantly higher incidence ofvaginal delivery within 24 hours and shorter inductionto delivery times, compared with the 25-␮g dose.11 The50-␮g dose was associated with a higher rate of uterinetachysystole (36.8% versus 17.4%; P ϭ .003) comparedwith the 25-␮g dose. However, there does not appear tobe a difference in uterine hyperstimulation syndrome(7.3% in the 50-␮g group versus 5.8% in the 25-␮ggroup).11 In the same analysis, there was no greaterObstetrics & Gynecology	13141	18525
554	1	4	42	1	5	incidence of adverse neonatal outcomes, thus, the onlyadvantage to using 25 ␮g appears to be a lower rate ofuterine tachysystole. We chose to use a 50-␮g dosingschedule because we believed it would provide the bestefﬁcacy and safety.Based on our experience,13 we agreed with Wing4that caution should be exercised when using misoprostol in women with previous uterine surgeries. Untilmore experience with misoprostol in these women isaccrued, we have abandoned its use at our institution.Despite the randomized design of this trial, therewere limitations. It was not possible to mask physiciansto type of ripening method. A strict protocol for ripening should have minimized potential bias. The intent ofthe trial was to determine the efﬁcacy of preinductioncervical ripening between methods, so no standardizedprotocol was devised or required for oxytocin administration or intrapartum management. Women withprevious cesarean deliveries were not admitted afterour adverse event, so the Foley in women with previouscesarean deliveries was not adequately studied. Wehave not had adverse events in women with previoussurgeries using the catheter. We currently offer cervicalripening with Foley catheter to women with previouscesarean deliveries.This report highlights the ability of the transcervicalFoley catheter to serve purely as a preinduction ripening agent, with women in this report requiring addedoxytocin to begin induction. Misoprostol, however, actsas a ripening agent and an induction agent, with closeto 40% of women entering labor without added oxytocin. Misoprostol’s dual role in induction offers the smalladvantage of less nursing time in preparation anddelivery of oxytocin.

Please see Dr. Mahoney?s reviewfor a discussion of safety exposures included in the NDA submission. Agreements were made on theproposal for antibody assessment and collection of adverse events. The plan for c-cell relatedmonitoring in the phase 3 trials that are at least 6 months in duration was deemed acceptable by theDivision.2.5.2 Type guidance (teleconference, 20 Sep?O5)The purpose of this meeting was to discuss initiation of the Phase 3 program for liraglutide in thecontext of concerns stemming from a 26 Feb 04 teleconference between the sponsor and the Divisionreporting the preliminary ?ndings from the 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies. The sponsor stated that 2-year rat toxicity studies indicated an increased frequency of C-cell tumors of the thyroid. The discussionpoints included questions related to proceeding with phase 3 studies in light of these ?ndings. Basedupon the limited clinical information that was available at that time, the following agreements werereached0 The Division agreed it was acceptable to proceed cautiously into Phase 3a studies without calcitoninmonitoring at 12 week intervals after unblinding of the data from the 14-week, European, Phase 2Study NN221 1-1571, provided that it yielded additional evidence of a lack of liraglutide effect oncalcitonin release.0 The Division stated that the available information was not yet sufficient to rule out the potentialhuman relevance of the rodent C-cell ?ndings. The sponsor was advised that unstimulated calcitoninmeasurement is not particularly sensitive to detect C-cell hyperplasia in humans. The Division urgedthe sponsor to perform a pentagastrin stimulated calcitonin test on a subset of subjects in Phase 3a atbaseline and at the end of the study. A0 The Division concurred that the exclusion of patients with elevated calcitonin or family history ofthyroid disease is not warranted.A ?nal discussion point was that the Division agreed upon the general design of an additional Phase 3study trial 1697 (see section 6.2.3.8.4_for a description of this trial).2.5.3 meeting (face to face, 5 Feb 08)Non-clinicalA major discussion point was the rodent thyroid C-cell ?nding. The Sponsor stated that it washypothesized that a non~genotoxic induction of the C-cell tumors occurs in rodents via a mechanism notrelevant for humans and asked if the Agency agreed that this hypothesis had been substantiated. TheDivision stated that the proposed mechanism of action of rodent C-cell thyroid tumors and their clinicalrelevance was a review issue and agreement could not be given at that time. A similar discussionoccurred with respect to calcitonin measurements, i.e. the Division stated that calcitonin measurementswould be a review issue and did not agree that it could be de?nitively concluded at that time thattreatment with liraglutide does not result in a clinically meaningful change in calcitonin secretion inhumans.15	49210	52305

The PPpopulation was used for supportive analyses.For all five therapeutic con?rmatory trials, the HbAlc change from baseline was analyzed using ananalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, country and previous anti-diabetic treatmentas ?xed effects and baseline HbAlc value as covariate. The primary endpoint was analyzed for both theITT analysis set and the PP analysis set. For tests of superiority, the ITT analysis set was considered theprimary test and the PP supportive, whereas for tests of noninferiority (noninferiority margin of the two analysis sets were considered of equal importance. In analyses based on the ITT analysis set,post-baseline missing values were replaced using last observation carried forward (LOCF). Furthermore,a sensitivity analysis without imputation was also done.All five therapeutic con?rmatory trials employed a hierarchical testing procedure in order to protect theoverall type I error rate (Figure 6.1 below).Figure 6.1 Hierarchical Testing Procedure for Phase 3 Studies38	101262	103266

Trial 1697 includedan open-label comparator arm (insulin glargine glimepiride metformin). The double-blind periodwas 26 weeks in the combination trials and 52 weeks in the monotherapy trial (Trial 1573). Two of thetherapeutic confirmatory trials have ongoing open-label extension periods (Trial 1573: 48 monthsextension and Trial 1572: 18 months extension), which provide additional long-term safety data.There were also 6 ongoing trials at the time of NDA submission for which no full study reports weresubmitted.

The phase 2 studieswere evaluated as supportive data in the clinical efficacy review. The long term extension studies werenot complete at the time of NDA submission, and therefore, were not reviewed to support efficacy.Literature was not relied on to support efficacy since liraglutide is a new molecular entity.Review strategy for the safety review is described in Dr. Mahoney?s review.4.4 Data Quality and IntegrityThe Division of Scienti?c Investigations (DSI) inspected two sites for this NDA.Andrew Lewin, M.D. was selected because he enrolled a relatively large number of subjects. At this site,for Protocol 1-1574, 34 subjects were screened, 26 subjects were enrolled, and eleven subjectscompleted the study. There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported. An audit of all 34subjects? records, including informed consent documents was conducted. No regulatory violations were25	69535	71375

613	1	4	50	1	3	DMD#60558AbstractImperatorin (IMP) is the major active ingredient in many common medicinalherbs. We examined the irreversible inhibitory effect of IMP on cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6). IMP produced a time- and concentration-dependent inactivation ofCYP2B6. About 70% of activity of CYP2B6 was suppressed after its incubation with1.5 M IMP for 9 min. KI and kinact were found to be 0.498 M and 0.079 min-1,μμrespectively.The loss of CYP2B6 activity required the presence of NADPH.Glutathione (GSH) and catalase/superoxide dismutase showed little protection againstthe IMP-induced enzyme inactivation. Ticlopidine, a substrate of CYP2B6, showedprotection of the enzyme against the inactivation induced by IMP. The estimatedpartition ratio of the inactivation was approximately 4. Additionally, a -ketoenalγintermediate was identified in microsomal incubations with IMP. CYPs 1A2, 2A6,2B6, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A5 were found to be involved in bioactivation of IMP. Inconclusion, IMP is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2B6. The formation of γketoenal intermediate may account for the enzyme inactivation.3	1891	2992

(liraglutide)Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism. and ExcretionLiraglutide has a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pro?le in humans suitable for once dailyadministration. Following subcutaneous administration, absorption is slow, reaching maximumconcentration 8-12 hours post dosing. Mean maximum concentration was 9.4 nmol/L for a singlesubcutaneous dose of 0.6 mg of liraglutide. At 1.8 mg, the average steady state concentrations reached33.7 nmol/L. Exposure was lower following s.c. administration of liraglutide in the thigh compared toabdomen, however, the observed difference in bioavailability between injection sites was minor and notconsidered by the sponsor to be of clinical relevance and therefore all injection sites (including the upperarm) could be used interchangeably in the pivotal clinical trials. The clinical pharmacology reviewerDr. Khurana agreed with this conclusion. The mean liraglutide apparent clearance was 0.7 L/hour andapparent volume of distribution was 12.5 after a single subcutaneous dose of 0.7 mg. Liraglutide waseliminated with an average half-life of 13 hours suggesting that liraglutide follows a flip-?oppharmacokinetics after subcutaneous administration - a situation where the half-life is observed to belonger after subcutaneous administration than that observed with the intravenous route. This suggeststhat the absorption process is slower than the elimination process. The dose-proportionality assessmentrevealed that liraglutide exposure increased in proportion to the increase in dose up to 20 ug/kg(equivalent to 1.8 mg dose based on 90 kg medianiweight in Phase 3 trials). There was slightaccumulation (RA of 1.4- 1.5) after multiple once daily subcutaneous administrations. The absolutebioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55% at 5 ug/kg. InTrial 1745, the relative bioavailability of liraglutide after s.c. administration in the thigh, upper arm andabdomen was estimated as relative ratios of for liraglutide after administration at the varioussites. The relative bioavailability of liraglutide after s.c. administration was estimated to 0.81 in thighversus abdomen, 0.90 in upper arm versus abdomen and 1.11 in upper arm versus thigh. Liraglutide isextensively bound to plasma protein 8In vitro and in vivo metabolism and excretion studies demonstrated that liraglutide is fully metabolizedin the body by sequential cleavage of the peptide with no excretion of liraglutide, i.e. neither renal norbiliary excretion are major routes of clearance, and only very limited excretion of closely relatedmetabolites in the feces or urine occurred in all tested animal species and humans. No unique humanmetabolite was found. Liraglutide was metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) and neutralendopeptidase (NEP) in similar positions in the peptide as observed for native .The potential inhibitory effect of liraglutide on the important human drug metabolizing cytochromeP4503 was examined in vitro using human liver microsomes. Data suggested that liraglutide atconcentrations up to 100 uM did not inhibit or only very inhibited all the human cytochromeP4505 studied (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4).Thus, liraglutide is not expected to cause any drug?drug interactions related to inhibition of cytochromeP4503.

(liraglutide)Several studies including the population pharmacokinetic analysis investigated the effect of body weightand BMI on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide. Most of the evidence suggested that the effect of bodyweight on exposure was statistically signi?cant with higher body weight associated with lower exposure(inverse relationship). See ?gure 5.1 below. However, the effect of BMI was not signi?cant. Weightbut not BMI was found to be a signi?cant predictor of clearance of liraglutide. According to the clinicalpharmacology reviewer Dr. Khurana, although weight was found to affect clearance, the effect does notappear to be clinically relevant. Considering that steady state exposures, resulting from 1.2 and 1.8 mgdoses, were in the maximal response region of the exposure-relationship for the primary ef?cacyvariable (HbAlc) (see section 5.3), these differences are not clinically meaningful to warrant a dose-adjustment.Figure 5.1.

In a single-dose trial (1327) the mean liraglutide plasma pro?les indicated that female subjects had higher plasmaconcentrations than male subjects. The difference appeared to be primarily explained by difference inbody weight between females and males, i.e. no statistically signi?cant difference between males andfemales was demonstrated for for liraglutide when corrected for body weight. In addition, nostatistically signi?cant differences between females and males were observed for other pharmacokineticendpoints.29	80750	82599

(liraglutide)5.2 PharmacodynamicsPlease refer to section 4.2 for tables of pharmacodynamic studies submitted with this NDA and to Dr.Khurana?s Clinical Pharmacology Review for details of the pharmacodynamic investigations. Results ofpharmacodynamic studies were consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of liraglutide. Thepharmacodynamic effects of liraglutide on glucodynamics were demonstrated. Liraglutideadministration resulted in increased insulin secretion in response to glucose. There was a signi?cantreduction in post?prandial glucose over a 24 hour period, slight increase in post-prandial insulin andsigni?cant post-prandial glucagon suppression. There was also a substantial increase in the first phaseinsulin secretion as assessed during a clamp. Please see Dr. Mahoney?s review (section 7.1.12) for a discussion of the thorough study.5.3 Exposure?Response RelationshipsAccording to the end-of?phase 2 meeting minutes, there was no specific determination of dose selectionfor the phase 3 program, although the Division did state that it found the phase 2 clinical pharmacologyprogram including doses tested during phase 2 acceptable. Therefore, the selection of the three dosestested in the phase 3 program, 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg was determined by the sponsor based on results ofphase 2 studies, speci?cally trial 1571 (source: sponsor?s summary of clinical ef?cacy, section 1.3.6).Monotherapy studies were used to evaluate the exposure-response relationship of liraglutide. Becausethe maximal mean reduction in HbAlc from baseline with liraglutide is achieved by week 12, the 12week data for the phase 2 (study 1310 and 1571) and phase 3 (trial 1573) monotherapy studies could becompared. A graphic examination of these data (?gure 5.1 below) showed that the response with 0.6 mgwas in reasonable proximity to half the maximal response. Graphical analysis of pooled dose?responsedata from phase 2 and 3 studies showed that liraglutide treatment is associated with a dose dependentreduction in HbAlc from baseline. The maximal effect is achieved at 1.2 mg dose with a numericaladvantage of 1.8 mg over 1.2 mg with regards to maximal HbAlc reduction. The consistent ?ndings ofmultiple studies and the identi?cation of what appears to be the maximal effective dose for HbAlclowering ?attening of the curve) provide evidence for adequacy of the clinical assessment and thisreviewer agrees these three doses were a reasonable choice for the phase 3 clinical trials.According to Dr. Khurana?s review, in the phase 2 program, there was a considerable overlap in theexposures for 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg doses so the two doses could not be differentiated using a doseresponse analysis. In patients with body weight 160 kg the expected mean average concentration (Cavg)is 9 nmol/L and 13 nmol/L using 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg dose, respectively. However, the liraglutideconcentration response change from baseline HbAlc) suggests that maximum effect is achieved at orabove 7 nmol/L liraglutide concentration (see Dr. Khurana?s review Fig. 15a). This was consistent forthe Phase 3 data where the liraglutide concentrations ranged from 5 nmol/L to 45 nmol/L (see Dr.Khurana?s review Fig. 15b). Hence, Dr. Khurana inferred that the proposed doses provide adequateliraglutide exposures over the body weight range of 40-1 60 kg and the sponsor?s proposed ?xed dosetitration is acceptable from clinical pharmacology perspective.31	85257	88749

In addition, ?beta-cellsparing? effect (evaluated on the basis of HbAlc trend after nadir) was a key secondary endpoint in the52 week monotherapy Trial 1573. The slope of the HbAlc by time pro?le after nadir was analyzed andcompared between treatment arms in Trial 1573. This endpoint is assumed to re?ect the long-term effectof treatment on beta-cell function.Reviewer?s comment: HbAlc trend after nadir is not a validated method of assessing beta-cellsparing effect. Past practices of the Division have been to not allow information about beta cellsparing into the label.Other reviewed secondary endpoints:Fasting plasma glucose measured at visits with a colorimetric assay kit using the glucose oxidasemethod at the central laboratory.Self-measured 7- and 8-point plasma glucose pro?les and post-prandial glucose. Subjects were asked toperform two consecutive days of 8-point plasma glucose pro?les at the start, middle, and end of t1j_2?ll which consisted of measuring glucose at the time points: before each meal, 90 minutes after thestart of each meal, at bedtime and at 3 am 30 minutes. (note: regular calibration of glucose meterswas left up to study participants). Calculated endpoints were mean prandial increments of glucose andmean post-prandial glucose (PPG). Mean post-prandial glucose was determined by obtaining a patient-measured glucometer reading taken 90 minutes after the start of each meal and then by taking theaverage of the measurement after each meal. -Reviewer?s comment: It is more rigorous to obtain PPG data in a clinic setting after astandardized meal or oral glucose tolerance test. When measured at home there are issues ofcompliance did patients measure at the right times) and also less accuracy with glucometersvs. lab measures in a clinic.

(liraglutide)- 6.1.3.1 Dose SelectionFixed dose levels of liraglutide were used in all ?ve therapeutic con?rmatory trials. Doses could beadministered in the three sites (thigh, abdomen, and upper arm) interchangeably. Based on the phase 2dose range ?nding trial, Trial 1571, three dose levels of liraglutide were chosen for the program oftherapeutic con?rmatory trials: 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg administered as a once-daily s.c. injection, but notall dose levels were evaluated in every trial. In trial 1310, a 12-week, multi-center, multi-national,seven-arm parallel-group trial with ?ve doses of liraglutide (0.045, 0.225, 0.45, 0.60 or 0.75 mg/day,double-blind) versus placebo double-blind) or glimepiride (1 or 2 mg, open?label) insubjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus showed the estimated dose for half-maximal effect on glycemiccontrol parameters (such as fasting plasma glucose and glucose pro?les), ED50, was 0.76 mg. As in the14-week dose range ?nding trial (Trial 1571) involving 163 subjects with type 2 diabetes, significantimprovement in glycemic control at all 3 tested dose levels (0.65, 1.25 and 1.9 mg/day) and a signi?cantreduction in body weight at the highest dose level were observed. These data formed the rationale for theplanned dose levels in the phase 3a program (0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day). The slight apparent difference indose levels between the NN2211-1571 trial and the phase 3a program was due to a change in the wayliraglutide content is declared, i.e. the dose levels were actually similar.See section 10.1 - Review of Individual Study Reports for details of the phase 2 dose ?nding studies.6.1.3.2 Duration of treatmentThe duration of treatment for all pivotal trials was 26 weeks, except Trial 1573, in which subjects weretreated for 52 weeks.6.1.3.3 Inclusion, and Exclusion Criteria Phase 3 TrialsThe inclusion, exclusion, and randomization criteria were similar across the ?ve trials. Therefore, asummary is presented below. Any important differences are highlighted in the specific study reviews.Inclusion Criteria - Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities- Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus- Age 18-80 years (both inclusive)- Body mass index 345.0 kg/m2With respect to previous antidiabetic therapy and baseline HbA]c, the inclusion criteria differed amongtrials, reflecting the different treatment combinations being studied:41	108158	110620

The run-in period (before randomization) was used to increase and maintain the dose levelof some of the concomitant OADs. Subjects already treated with the relevant OAD could advancedirectly to the maintenance period. The speci?ed maintenance period was mandatory for all subjects.Table 6.3Run in Period for Phase 3 TrialsTrial 1572 Metformin to 2 (3 weeks titration, 3 weeks maintenance)Trial 1436 Glimepiride to 4 mg (2 weeks titration, 2 weeks maintenance)Trial 1574 Metformin to 2 and rosiglitazone to 8 mg (2 weeks titration, 6 weeksmaintenance)Trial 1697 Metformin to 2 and glimepiride to 4 mg (3 weeks titration, 3 weeksmaintenance) . For all trials, the randomized treatment period included an initial period of forced dose escalation toreach the intended daily dose level. The main reason for dose escalation for liraglutide was becausestarting at the dose of liraglutide resulted in increased gastrointestinal adverse effects.- For subjects randomized to 1.2 or 1.8 mg liraglutide/day, an initial dose of 0.6 mg/day was used duringthe first week, followed by 1 or 2 weeks after which the dose was increased by 0.6 mg per week.- For Trial 1573, four weeks of forced dose escalation with glimepiride to reach 8 mg/day.- For Trial 1572, three weeks of forced dose escalation with glimepiride to reach 4 mg/day.Reviewer?s comments: The run in period for most of these trials was sufficient to reac.h steadystate, but generally too short to be re?ected in the baseline Hbalc values, although by the end ofthe run-in period subjects had some relatively low HbAlc values at the baseline43	113789	116626

(liraglutide)titration, as only the starting dose of glargine was speci?ed in the protocol and the subsequent titrationwas managed by the subject.Reviewer?s comments: the baseline value for HbAlc was determined at visit 3 at the same time asrandomization. This visit occurred at a minimum of 3 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks afterdiscontinuation of pre-study OADs and initiation of the study drugs of metformin and glimepirideat visit 2. The baseline HbAlc will re?ect pre-study OAD doses as well as the metformin andglimepiride initiated at study entry.The starting dose of glargine seems very low and would result in inadequate therapy. Howeverthe titration guideline would allow the glargine dose to reach clinically effective levels over time.At the end of 26 weeks this reviewer would expect the glargine dosed in this manner to be a faircomparator to liraglutide.All subjects treated with insulin glargine were instructed to measure their fasting plasma glucosefrequently for the purpose of insulin glargine titration. This behavior might encourage greatercompliance.    Study Design Protocol deviations: The Sponsor lists two study design protocol deviations 1) As the NGSP Level I certi?cationifor testing of HbAlc at expired at the end of August2006, a transfer of HbAlc analyses from. to the laboratory in was done for allsamples from sites in as of 17 September 2006. Samples analyzed at between the endof August and until the transfer to (Level 11 analysis) were reanalyzed at for HbAlcunless there was no sample material left, which was the case for 8 subjects (817003, 817004, 817009,817010, 818015, 819023, 820009 and 820010). There were 52 subjects from sites in ;totalalthough it is not reported how many of these subjects were affected by the protocol deviation hadsamples dating from 17 September 2006).2) There was a discrepancy between the laboratory and the protocol?s conversion factor between umol/Land mg/dL for serum creatinine; the limits in mg/dL for the exclusion criteria regarding impaired renalfunction (exclusion criterion no. 4) were 21.53 mg/dL for males and 21.24 mg/dL for females. Thisinformation was included in the amendment to central laboratory speci?cations   Reviewer?s comment: Potentially 52 subjects out of a total of 581 randomized subjectswould be affected by this protocol deviation. The Sponsor did not report if the samples wereappropriately transferred and handled and did not report if HbAlc values obtained at  were similar to the results obtained from reanalysis at However, this reviewer and thestatistical reviewer believe that the overall assessment of ef?cacy in the liraglutide developmentprogram would not be signi?cantly affected by this deviation (note: this issue is not addressed inthe written Statistical Review which was formalized before this issue came to light, but wasdiscussed in person with Dr. Derr). This deviation could, however, have labeling implications asclinical data are presented separately for each trial in the label. Therefore, the Sponsor was askedon 23 Jul 2009 to provide the following:1. A reanalysis of the primary ef?cacy endpoint (change in HbAlc at the end of 26 weeks) for trial54	140829	144075

Rouse,c Diana Severynse-Stevens,c Elliott Pauli,c Daniel EverittbSchool of Pharmacy, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealanda; Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, New York, New York, USAb; RTI International, ResearchTriangle Park, North Carolina, USAcPA-824 is an antitubercular nitroimidazo-oxazine that possesses signiﬁcant activity against replicating and nonreplicating/persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis via a complex mechanism of action distinct from that of any currently marketed drugsfor the treatment of tuberculosis (1, 2). Its mechanism of action isbelieved similar to that of Delamanid, a drug currently under review for market approval by the regulatory authorities (3). PA-824interferes with M. tuberculosis cell wall biosynthesis by inhibitingthe oxidation of hydroxymycolate to ketomycolate. A deazaﬂavin(F420)-dependent nitroreductase has also been identiﬁed whoseactivity in M. tuberculosis cells is involved in PA-824 activationand activity (2). Reduction of PA-824 to its des-nitroimidazolemetabolite by this nitroreductase is associated with generation ofreactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide. PA-824 is activeagainst M. tuberculosis isolates resistant to single or multiple antituberculous drugs and has proven effective in shortening treatment time of drug-sensitive M. tuberculosis in a murine model oftuberculosis (TB) as part of novel drug regimens (4). Moreover,PA-824 was highly active as monotherapy in a 14-day dose rangingearly bactericidal activity (EBA) study in humans where similarefﬁcacy proﬁles were observed across all doses assessed (200 to1,200 mg/day) (5). In EBA studies, the rate of change over time inthe number of M. tuberculosis CFU per ml of sputum in an overnight sputum collection is used to compare different dosing andtreatment regimens. In a follow up study exploring a lower doserange (50 to 200 mg/day), a dose-response trend was detected withdoses 100 mg/day and above showing similar efﬁcacy proﬁles (6).In addition, in a 14-day EBA study of novel antituberculosis drugcombinations, the combination of PA-824 (200 mg/day), moxiﬂoxacin (400 mg/day), and pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg [bodyweight]/day) demonstrated EBA activity comparable to the current World Health Organization-recommended gold standardtherapy of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (7).Based on the results of these EBA studies, the expected therapeuticAugust 2013 Volume 57 Number 8doses of 100 and 200 mg/day are being evaluated in longer termtrials in patients with pulmonary TB.The current treatment of TB is greatly complicated by the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) co-epidemic. In 2011, 13%of the estimated 8.7 million new cases of TB were coinfected withHIV and, of the 1.4 million deaths from TB, 430,000 deaths wereamong patients who were also HIV positive (8). The treatment ofTB alone requires the use of multiple antibiotics to prevent thedevelopment of drug resistance. The use of multiple antiretroviralagents to treat HIV infection greatly increases the likelihood ofdrug-drug interactions for patients with both infections. Manyimportant drugs used to treat HIV infection, such as the proteaseinhibitors nevirapine, lopinavir, and ritonavir, are substrates ofCYP3A4 and/or p-glycoprotein and have interactions with drugsfor the treatment of TB, such as rifampin, that are inducers ofhepatic enzymes (9). In vitro data indicate that PA-824 is not aninducer but is a weak substrate and potential weak inhibitor ofCYP3A4 (data not shown). An assessment of PA824’s drug-druginteraction potential is critical to determine its place in future TBtherapy.The present study was designed to ascertain whether PA-824affected the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, a sensitiveprobe substrate and representative compound for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Midazolam is one of the most commonly used invivo and in vitro CYP3A4 probe substrates for drug-drug interaction studies.Received 17 January 2013 Returned for modiﬁcation 1 March 2013Accepted 15 May 2013Published ahead of print 20 May 2013Address correspondence to Daniel Everitt, dan.everitt@tballiance.org.Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

The study followed up on observations in vitro that PA-824 caused weak and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Subjects received a single oral dose ofmidazolam (2 mg), followed by a 2-day washout. After the washout, all subjects received PA-824 (400 mg) once daily for 14 consecutive days. On day 14, all subjects received the ﬁnal PA-824 dose coadministered with a 2-mg oral dose of midazolam. Thepharmacokinetic endpoints AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ؕ, and Cmax for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam were compared betweenmidazolam administered alone versus midazolam coadministered with PA-824. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the meanmidazolam values of Cmax, AUC0 –t, and AUC0 –ؕ parameters were reduced by ca. 16, 15, and 15%, respectively, when PA-824 wascoadministered with midazolam. The total exposure (AUC) of 1-hydroxy midazolam was 13 to 14% greater when coadministered with PA-824 compared to midazolam administered alone. The Cmax of 1-hydroxy midazolam was similar between treatments. Based on these results, PA-824 does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4 to a clinically meaningful extent and is not likely tomarkedly affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 metabolized drugs.	965	6876

The PA-824 calibration range for quantitationwas 10 to 10,000 ng/ml. Accuracy ranged from 96.3 to 100%, and precision (RSD) ranged from 1.7 to 4.4%.Midazolam, 1-hydroxy midazolam, and the internal standard ␣-hydroxytriazolam (added during sample processing) were extracted fromhuman plasma samples using liquid-liquid extraction. After evaporationunder nitrogen, the residue was reconstituted and analyzed using liquidchromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection according toa validated method proprietary to Covance Laboratories, Inc. The midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam calibration range for quantitation was0.1 to 100 ng/ml. Accuracy ranged from 102.0 to 102.7% and from 102 to103.3% for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam, respectively. Precision(RSD) ranged from 4.5 to 6.3% and from 3.3 to 4.7% for midazolam and1-hydroxy midazolam, respectively.PK analysis. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam plasma PK parameters were calculated for each subject when midazolam was dosedalone and in combination with PA-824 by applying a noncompartmentalapproach using WinNonlin professional version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corp.,Mountain View, CA). The key PK parameters calculated for midazolamand 1-hydroxy midazolam included Cmax (the maximum observed concentration), Tmax (the time at which Cmax occurs), kel (the terminal elimination rate constant), t1/2 (the elimination half-life), AUC0 –t (the areaunder the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval), andAUC0 –ϱ (the area under concentration-time curve extrapolated toinﬁnity).Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) werehandled in the following manner. The lower limit of quantitation formidazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam bioanalysis was 0.1 ng/ml. PK parameters were not calculated for subjects for whom there were insufﬁcientdata. For the calculation of the PK parameters, plasma concentrations thatwere BLQ prior to the ﬁrst quantiﬁable concentration were set to zero, andplasma concentrations BLQ after the ﬁrst quantiﬁable concentration weretreated as missing. For each subject, the elimination rate constant (kel) wasestimated by unweighted log-linear regression using at least three datapoints from the last portion of the plasma concentration proﬁle accordingto the least-squares approach ending with the last concentration prior tothe ﬁrst assay that was below the limit of quantiﬁcation. The eliminationhalf-life (t1/2) was calculated from the kel, using the formula ln(2)/kel. Thekel was not assigned if the terminal elimination phase was not apparent, ifCmax was one of the three last data points, or if the R2 value was Ͻ80%. Incases where the kel interval was not assigned, the values of kel, AUC0 –ϱ,and t1/2 were considered not calculable and were not reported. When theresulting t1/2 was more than half as long as the sampling interval, the kelvalues and associated parameters (t1/2 and AUC0 –ϱ) were not presented.AUCs were calculated by using linear trapezoidal summation from timezero to the speciﬁed time point (either the last available time point or byextrapolation to inﬁnity).Statistical analysis. All descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated in SAS version 9.1.3. Plasma concentration values for midazolam,1-hydroxy midazolam, and PA-824 were listed and summarized usingdescriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics were calculated for PK parameters. The PK endpoints AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ϱ, and Cmax for midazolam and1-hydroxy midazolam were compared between midazolam alone versusmidazolam with PA-824 using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.The ANOVA model using SAS PROC mixed procedure included treatment, period, and sequence as ﬁxed effects and subject within sequence asa random effect. For the present study, a potentially clinically importanteffect of PA-824 on midazolam pharmacokinetics, as speciﬁed in the protocol, would be concluded if the 90% conﬁdence interval (CI) for thegeometric mean ratios (GMRs) of AUC0 –t, AUC0 –ϱ, and Cmax were notcontained within the prespeciﬁed “no-effect” 50 to 200% CI limit. If theGMRs were below 50% or above 200%, then a clinically important effectwould be concluded. For the purposes of this study, a clinically importanteffect was considered to be a drug interaction of sufﬁcient magnitude toAntimicrobial Agents and ChemotherapyDownloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on October 21, 2014 by guestStudy design. A phase I study was conducted to evaluate the effects of themultiple-dose administration of PA-824 on the PK of orally administeredmidazolam and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PA-824 whencoadministered with midazolam. The study was an open-label, multidose,ﬁxed-sequence design performed in keeping with the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration’s industry guidance (10). The clinical study was conducted by Celerion, Inc. (formerly MDS Pharma Services, Inc.), in Lincoln, NE, under the sponsorship of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.Subjects were enrolled into the study and housed in the clinical facilityfrom the evening of day 1 (at least 15 h before dosing) through the morning of day 18. The total study duration for each subject from check-inthrough study termination (including a 2-day washout) spanned 18nights and 19 days, with follow-up evaluation over 3 months.All subjects received an initial single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolamCIV hydrochloride syrup (Boehringer Ingelheim/Roxane Laboratories)administered with 240 ml of water, followed by a 2-day washout. After thewashout, all subjects received 400 mg of PA-824 (two 200-mg tablets)administered with 240 ml of water once daily for 14 consecutive days. Onthe day 14 of PA-824 dosing, a single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolam wascoadministered with 400 mg of PA-824 with 240 ml of water. Subjectsfasted for a minimum of 8 h prior to and 4 h after dosing. Water waspermitted ad libitum 1 h prior to and then again 1 h after dosing. Subjectsremained in an upright position (seated or standing) for 4 h after dosing.Dietary restrictions included caffeine, alcohol, poppy seeds, and grapefruit products prior to and throughout the study. No medication waspermitted without sponsor approval except acetaminophen.Subject inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were included ifthey were healthy nonsmokers aged 19 to 50, with a body mass index of 18to 29, inclusive, with negative tests for alcohol and drugs of abuse. Subjectswere excluded if they had any clinically signiﬁcant history or presence of acardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal,endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, or neurologic disease/disorder.Subjects also were excluded if they had a psychological, psychiatric, ormetabolic disorder (including eating disorders) or if they had experiencedany acute illness within 4 weeks. Female subjects were excluded if theywere pregnant (positive test for serum human chorionic gonadotropin atscreening or check-in), breast feeding, or planning to conceive a childwithin 30 days of cessation of treatment. Male subjects were excluded ifthey were planning to father a child within 12 weeks of cessation of treatment. Finally, subjects were excluded if they had a lens opacity or evidenceof lens opacity on slit-lamp ophthalmologic examination to follow up onﬁndings that some rats developed cataracts in toxicology studies at highdoses over 3 to 6 months of dosing.All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participationin the study. Study protocols and consent forms were reviewed and approved by Celerion’s Institutional Review Board, and the study was conducted in accordance with U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Parts50, 56, and 312) principles and requirements and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines (ICH E6).Sampling. PK blood samples for midazolam (obtained once, 6 ml)were collected prior to dosing and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and24 h after each 2-mg oral dose of midazolam. PK blood samples for PA824 (obtained once, 6 ml) were collected predose on days 12 and 13 ofconsecutive PA-824 dosing and predose on the day 14 prior to coadministration.Bioanalytical methods. Blood samples were collected and centrifuged, and plasma was separated and stored at Ϫ20°C. Plasma sampleswere analyzed for PA-824, midazolam, and the midazolam metabolite1-hydroxy midazolam using separately validated liquid chromatographymass spectrometry methods developed at Covance Laboratories, Inc.PA-824 and the internal standard, triazolam (added during sampleprocessing), were extracted from human plasma samples using liquidliquid extraction.

If the GMRs were within the 50 to200% limit, then sequentially narrower criteria would be tested, i.e., 70 to143%. If these narrower criteria were met, then the standard “no-effect”or bioequivalence criteria, 80 to 125%, were to be assessed. The intendedsample size was based on the known variability in the AUC and Cmaxassociated with midazolam. Sample size calculations were based on astudy by Stoch et al. (11), who reported 90% CIs for GMRs of midazolamAUCs based on within-subject AUC variability and midazolam 2-mg oraldoses in the presence of ketoconazole. The natural log-scale standarddeviations (SD) computed from these CIs were 0.22 for AUC and 0.31 forCmax. Twelve subjects provided Ͼ96% power of yielding a 90% CI forAUC or Cmax within 0.5 to 2.0 bounds if the true underlying GMR was1.00. Midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam t1/2 and Tmax were comparedbetween midazolam alone versus midazolam with PA-824 using the Student t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. If the t1/2 and Tmax data failedtests for normality, only the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results were reported.RESULTSA total of 14 healthy male (n ϭ 10) and female (n ϭ 4) subjectsparticipated in this clinical study to assess the safety, tolerability,and PK parameters of midazolam when coadministered with PA824. All subjects were 19 to 46 years old (mean, 27.2 years), had abody mass index of 18 to 29 (mean, 25.4 kg/m2), and were medically healthy as determined by the principal investigator based ontheir medical history, clinical laboratory results, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examination. At both screening and check-in, subjects had negative urine test results foralcohol and other drugs of abuse, such as amphetamines, cannabinoids, and cocaine metabolites. Study participants represented aracially diverse group consisting of one Asian, one black, two Hispanic, and 10 white subjects. All 14 subjects who were enrolled inthe study completed all of the study procedures, and there were nodropouts.Pharmacokinetics.

The predose mean PA-824plasma concentrations Ϯ the SD on days 12, 13, and 14 for theonce-daily administration of 400 mg of PA-824 were 1,637 Ϯ 610,1,581 Ϯ 539, and 1,607 Ϯ 556 ng/ml, respectively. PA-824 plasmaconcentrations showed no sign of additional accumulation, indicating that steady-state had been achieved for PA-824 prior to thedosing of midazolam. These PA-824 plasma concentrations aresimilar to those found in earlier multiple-dose studies using similar doses.The GMRs (90% CI) when midazolam was coadministeredwith PA-824 compared to when midazolam was administeredalone were as follows: Cmax ϭ 83.63% (75.11 to 93.11%),AUC0 –t ϭ 84.61% (74.21 to 96.47%), and AUC0 –ϱ ϭ 84.45%(73.79 to 96.64%).

The 90% CIs for the GMRs of the AUCs and Cmax valueswere not within the “no-effect” limit of 80 to 125%. The totalextent (AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of midazolam decreasedby ca. 15 to 16% when midazolam was coadministered with PA824 compared to when midazolam was administered alone. Basedon the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the midazolamTmax (P ϭ 0.891) and t1/2 (P ϭ 0.893) were not different betweenboth treatments.As seen in Table 2, a statistical analysis of 1-hydroxy midazolam PK parameters demonstrated that the GMRs (90% CI) whenmidazolam was coadministered with PA-824 compared to whenmidazolam was administered alone were as follows: Cmax ϭ105.23% (93.13 to 118.9%), AUC0 –t ϭ 113.98% (105.53 to123.09%), and AUC0 –ϱ ϭ 112.68% (103.07 to 123.18%). Thelower bound of the 90% CIs for the GMRs of the AUCs wasϾ100% but all were within the “no-effect” limit of 80 to 125%.Based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the 1-hydroxy midazolam Tmax (P ϭ 0.988) and t1/2 (P ϭ 1.00) values werenot different between both treatments.Safety and tolerability. PA-824 was well tolerated throughoutthe study and when coadministered with midazolam. No seriousadverse events occurred. The only adverse events reported bymore than one subject during any treatment period were headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. These eventswere reported more commonly by subjects during the periodswhen PA-824 was administered alone or in combination withmidazolam. There was a trend toward increased serum creatinineconcentrations during dosing with PA-824, a ﬁnding consistentwith an earlier study that determined that higher doses of PA-824do not affect renal function but may increase serum creatinine byinhibiting renal tubular secretion of creatinine, a clinically benigneffect that has been seen with several marketed drugs (12). Mean(SD) serum creatinine concentrations were 0.785 (0.173) atcheck-in, 0.811 (0.184) when midazolam was dosed alone, 0.916(0.175) after 7 days of once-daily dosing of PA-824, and 0.955(0.189) after 14 days of once-daily dosing of PA-824 with coadministration of midazolam on day 14. All other mean laboratoryparameters for serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis remained within reference range. There were no remarkable ﬁndings in the vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, visual acuitytests, and slit-lamp examinations in this study.3702 aac.asm.orgDISCUSSIONWhen this study was designed, the clinical dose range in patientswith TB had not been determined. The 400-mg PA-824 dose usedhere was chosen as the highest dose that might be used in futureclinical studies. The 400-mg PA-824 dose was expected to producethe maximum change in midazolam exposure relevant to theclinic. Any effects observed at the 400-mg PA-824 dose level couldbe extrapolated to lower doses of PA-824, potentially requiringadditional studies to appropriately characterize the drug interaction at lower clinical doses. The 50 to 200% limit for the 90% CI ofthe GMR was chosen as a “no-effect” criterion based on a clinicalassessment that if dose adjustment of important drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 were required during coadministration of PA824, then continued development of PA-824 as a therapy for TBwould not be warranted. The 2-mg oral midazolam dose is at thelower range of that typically used in drug-drug interaction studies,but it was chosen due to concerns over the possible magnitude ofCYP3A4 time-dependent inhibition after a 14-day dosing of PA824.The total extent (AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of midazolam decreased by ca. 16 and 15%, respectively, with the concomitant coadministration of midazolam and PA-824 400 mg compared to the administration of midazolam alone. The total extent(AUC) and peak (Cmax) exposure of 1-hydroxy midazolam increased 14 and 5%, respectively, with the concomitant coadministration of midazolam and PA-824 compared to the administration of midazolam alone. The 90% CI values for the GMRs ofAUC0 –t, AUC0Ϫϱ, and Cmax for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam were all within the prespeciﬁed “no-effect” 50 to 200% limitand within the narrower prespeciﬁed 70 to 143% limit, whereasonly the 1-hydroxy midazolam GMRs also fell within the defaultbioequivalence 80 to 125% limit. The relatively small decrease inmidazolam exposure, together with the small increase in 1-hydroxy midazolam exposure observed when midazolam is coadministered, appears to be consistent with a small inductive effectby PA-824 on CYP3A4. This result appears inconsistent with invitro data indicating that PA-824 is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4and exhibits metabolism-dependent inhibition. However, our invitro metabolism data are too limited to indicate the likely mechanism. It has been reported that some metabolism-dependent inhibiters can form relatively stable PA-824 metabolite enzymecomplexes resulting in decreased degradation of the enzyme itselfAntimicrobial Agents and ChemotherapyDownloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on October 21, 2014 by guestan, number of subjects contributing data; Cmax, maximum observed concentration; AUC0 –t, area under the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval; AUC0 –ϱ, areaunder the concentration-time curve extrapolated to inﬁnity; LS mean, least-squares mean; GMR, geometric mean ratio; CI, conﬁdence interval.	20404	26431

Midazolam is known to exhibit allosteric activation of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism with some drugs. Allosteric activation involvesthe binding of an “activator” to the enzyme, resulting in an increased rate of metabolism. 1-Hydroxy midazolam forms a glucuronide metabolite. Glucuronide metabolites can be excreted bytransporters in the kidney and other tissues. Increased serum creatinine concentrations were detected. It is possible that PA-824inhibition of a common transporter for creatinine and 1-hydroxymidazolam might have led to the increased 1-hydroxy midazolamexposure that we observed. However, the decrease in midazolamexposure that we detected is not consistent with the inhibition of arenal transporter.We demonstrated that PA-824 at the 400-mg dose does notproduce changes in midazolam exposure that would require doseadjustment. Any changes in midazolam exposure that occur forthe 100- and 200-mg PA-824 doses are likely to be even less thanthat observed for the 400-mg dose. Therefore, our ﬁndings indicate that PA-824 is not likely to affect the PK of CYP3A4-metabolized drugs to a clinically meaningful extent. Most importantly,concomitant use of PA-824 is not expected to produce signiﬁcantdrug interactions with antiretroviral drugs that are substrates ofCYP3A4, such as the protease inhibitors. Overall, single doses oforal midazolam (2 mg) administered alone and then after multiple doses of PA-824 (400 mg daily for 14 days) with a single oraldose of midazolam (2 mg on day 14 of PA-824 dosing) were welltolerated by the subjects in our study.	26432	31490

A six-month double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, active control, para1lel?group, multicenter, multinational trial with an18 months extension period.Hypothesis: Combination therapy of liraglutide and metformin will provide glycemic control (asmeasured by glycosylated hemoglobin [HbAlc]) signi?cantly better than metformin monotherapy, andat least as good as or better than that achieved by metformin and glimepiride combination therapy insubjects with type 2 diabetes.This was a multicenter (170 centers in 21 countries), double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, study.Subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on OADs (HbA1c 7.5-11% inclusive) wererandomized in a 212:2: 1 :2 ratio to:Liraglutide active (0.6 mg/day) glimepiride placebo metformin (1 .5-2.0 g/day)Liraglutide active (1.2 mg/day) glimepiride placebo metformin (1.5-2.0 g/day)Liraglutide active (1.8 mg/day) glimepiride placebo metformin (1 .5?2.0 g/day)Liraglutide placebo glimepiride placebo metformin (1 .5-2.0 g/day)Liraglutide placebo glimepiride (4 mg/day) metformin (1 .5-2.0 g/day)Dose Adjustments:After randomization the dose level of metformin could, at the discretion of the investigator, be decreasedto a minimum of 1500 mg /day in case of unacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. Likewise,the metformin dose could be increased again to 2000 mg/day. If a dose level less than 1500 mg/day ormore than 2000 mg/day was required, the subject had to be withdrawn from the trial (see also section6.1.3.6 Withdrawal and rescue).Reviewer's comment: Although the maximum recommended dose of metformin is 3,000 mg daily,the 2000 mg dose used in this trial is considered the maximally/near?maximally efficacious dose(Garber 1997) and is commonly used in trials of antidiabetic medications.The doses of liraglutide and glimepiride were to be maintained throughout the trial.Inclusion criteria differed from those presented in section 6.1.3.3 in that:1.

This article is published with open access at Springerlink.comAbstractPurpose Vercirnon is a CCR9 chemokine receptor antagonistbeing developed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. As avariety of concomitant medications are often required for thetreatment of Crohn’s disease, it is important to characterise thedrug interaction profile of vercirnon. To confirm the results ofprevious in vitro inhibition studies, this study assessed thein vivo effect of vercirnon on the activity of cytochrome P450enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2C8) and drug transport proteins (BCRP and OATP1B1) using probe substrates.Methods This was an open-label, single-sequence, repeatdose study conducted in 24 healthy adult subjects. On days1–4, subjects received probe substrates (midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole and rosuvastatin; in that order), followed byadministration of vercirnon 500 mg twice daily (BID) on days5–14. On days 11–14, in addition to vercirnon 500 mg BID,subjects also received probe substrates as on days 1–4. Bloodsamples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis of probesubstrates, vercirnon and two of its metabolites.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article(doi:10.1007/s00228-013-1592-7) contains supplementary material,which is available to authorized users.L.

Vercirnon . CYP3A4 .CYP2C19 . CYP2C8 . BCRP . OATP1B1IntroductionVercirnon (formerly CCX282-B or GSK1605786) is a highlypotent, orally active, chemokine receptor antagonist whosesingle target is the G-protein–coupled receptor CCR9,which has been implicated in the aetiology of inflammatorybowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease [1–4]. Crohn’sdisease is a chronic, idiopathic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract associated with adysregulated activation of immune cell function. It canaffect any portion of the GI tract but most commonly affectsthe terminal small intestine and colon [5]. Current treatments for subjects with Crohn’s disease consist of corticosteroids, immunosuppressives (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, mercaptopurine and azathioprine), and tumour necrosisfactor inhibitors (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab).Although there have been recent advances in the treatment of	0	3669
575	1	4	47	1	2	38patients with Crohn’s disease [6], there is still an unmetmedical need for new therapies [5, 7]. Currently, patients withCrohn’s disease use multiple prescription and non-prescriptionmedications to treat their inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)symptoms and other systemic and non-IBD disease-relatedconditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart disease). Consequently, patients with Crohn’s disease have a potentiallyhigher risk for drug–drug interactions compared with thegeneral population [8].Following oral administration (250 to 1,000 mg), vercirnonis readily absorbed with a time to maximum concentration(tmax) of 3–4 h and an estimated half-life between 12 and17 h [9]. Once absorbed, vercirnon is extensively metabolisedby multiple oxidative and reductive pathways, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2C19and CYP2B6 (ChemoCentryx, data on file). Vercirnon ispassively permeable and unlikely to be a substrate for humanp-glycoprotein transporter protein or other transport proteins,and its metabolites are highly protein bound (>90 %) with lowuptake of drug-related material into tissues (ChemoCentryx,data on file). Based on these observations, the potential forother drugs to have a clinically-significant effect on vercirnonwas predicted to be low.No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate thepotential for vercirnon to affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) ofother drugs. Due to the high plasma protein binding forvercirnon and its metabolites, and the relatively low anticipated liver concentrations estimated from likely therapeutic plasma concentrations (maximum observed concentration [Cmax]range 3–5 μM for vercirnon and <0.5 μM for metabolites;ChemoCentryx, data on file), the potential for vercirnon tosignificantly affect the clearance of other drugs utilising CYPenzymes as a primary clearance pathway was considered to below. However, the estimated [I]/Ki ratio, where [I] representsthe mean steady-state Cmax value for total drug (bound plusunbound) following administration of the highest proposedclinical dose of vercirnon, was between 0.1 and 1.0 for cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8activity. This indicated a “possible” interaction requiring afollow-up clinical evaluation [10]. In addition, in vitro studiesshowed that vercirnon can inhibit breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and organic anion transporter (OAT) proteins,specifically OAT1B1, OAT1 and OAT3 (ChemoCentryx andGlaxoSmithKline, data on file).It is important to confirm these in vitro findings and characterise the drug interaction profile of vercirnon in humans tosupport late-phase clinical trials, as patients with Crohn’sdisease are often prescribed multiple medications, such asimmunosuppressants, GI anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics and pain relievers. This study investigated the potentialeffect of steady-state vercirnon on CYP3A4, CYP2C19 andCYP2C8 activity, plus BCRP and OATP1B1 transporter activity, by evaluating the effect of vercirnon co-administrationEur J Clin Pharmacol (2014) 70:37–45on the PK of well-established probe substrates for eachenzyme/transporter [11]. As a secondary objective, the systemic exposure of two metabolites: GSK2635622 andGSK2656694, relative to the parent drug, vercirnon, wereassessed following single and repeat dosing of vercirnon. Inaddition, exploratory pharmacogenetic (PGx) evaluationswere conducted to investigate the relationship between genetic variants in drug metabolism and transporter genes, andinter-individual variability in PK parameters.MethodsSubjectsA total of 24 subjects were enrolled to ensure that at least 16subjects would complete the study. Subjects were eligible toparticipate if they were a healthy adult male or female,of non-childbearing potential, 18–55 years of age withbody weight ≥60 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the19–30 kg/m2 range. Subjects were excluded from the study ifthey were pregnant, smoked, or had liver disease, active orlatent tuberculosis, coeliac disease or a positive serologic testfor tissue transglutaminase (tTG), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, orhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Subjects were alsoexcluded if they had drug or alcohol problems, blood pressureabnormalities, mental/legal incapacities, sensitivities, medicalconditions judged by the principal investigator to be unsuitable for the study, or if they had consumed red wine, citrusfruits, fruit juices, vegetables from the mustard green family orcharbroiled meats within 7 days prior to the first dose of studymedication. No alcohol, caffeine, or concomitant medicationswere allowed while in the clinic. All subjects provided writteninformed consent before any study-specific procedures wereperformed.The study was conducted in accordance with good clinicalpractice and all applicable regulatory requirements under theDeclaration of Helsinki at a single site: Buffalo Clinical Research Center, Buffalo, NY, USA. A local Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the study.Study design and treatmentsThis was an open-label, single-sequence, repeat-dose study(CCX114671; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01489943)designed to evaluate the effect of repeat doses of vercirnonon the PK of probe substrates of three CYP enzymes and twotransporter proteins in healthy subjects. The probes used toinvestigate the enzyme and transporter activity were: midazolam for CYP3A4, pioglitazone for CYP2C8, omeprazole forCYP2C19, and rosuvastatin for BCRP and OATP1B1. Allprobe substrates were administered orally and at doses thatwould provide adequate concentrations of parent and/or	3670	9257

The probe compounds were administered in themorning on the study days outlined in Table 1. Vercirnon500 mg was administered twice a day (BID), after a meal,on days 5–14. Eligible subjects were admitted to the clinicalunit on day -1 (day before first dose) and remained in-houseuntil day 15. On days 1, 2, 3 and 4 they received single dosesof the probe compounds: midazolam 3 mg oral syrup, pioglitazone 15 mg tablet, omeprazole 40 mg capsule androsuvastatin 10 mg tablet, respectively. This was followedby vercirnon 2 x 250-mg capsules BID on days 5–10. Ondays 11, 12, 13 and 14, in addition to vercirnon 500 mg BID,subjects also received the probe compound in the same orderas days 1–4.For each morning dose, subjects were required to fastovernight. Subjects were served a moderate fat breakfast(i.e., fed state) consisting of approximately 28 % fat and700 cal. Thirty minutes after breakfast was served, studymedication was administered with 240 mL of water. For eachevening dose of vercirnon, subjects were also served a standard meal 30 min prior to dosing. Serial blood samples werecollected over a 24-h period following the administration ofall probe substrates; except for rosuvastatin, where sampleswere collected over 48 h. Full details of sample collection andprobe substrate analysis (including validation, precision andaccuracy ranges) are provided in Online Resource 1. Systemiclevels of the probe substrates when co-administered withvercirnon were compared with systemic levels when theprobes were administered alone. On study days 5–10, singletrough concentrations were collected immediately prior todosing. Additionally, a subset of subjects volunteered to haveserial blood samples collected over 24 h on study days 5 and10 for analysis of vercirnon and its metabolites, GSK2635622and GSK2656694. All subjects returned to the unit for afollow-up visit within 7–10 days after the last dose of studymedication before being discharged from the study. The totalduration of a subject’s participation in the study, includingscreening (∼30 days), treatment and the follow-up visit wasapproximately 54 days.Table 1 Summary of treatment administrationsStudy dayProbe and/or study drugDay 1Pioglitazone 15 mgOmeprazole 40 mgRosuvastatin 10 mgVercirnon [500 mg BID]Vercirnon [500 mg BID] + midazolam 3 mgVercirnon [500 mg BID] + pioglitazone 15 mgVercirnon [500 mg BID] + omeprazole 40 mgVercirnon [500 mg BID] + rosuvastatin 10 mgSample size considerationsThe potential effect of vercirnon on the probe substratesevaluated in this study was assessed by comparing the ratioof area under the concentration curve from zero to infinity(AUC 0–∞) of the probe substrate in combination withvercirnon (test) to the AUC0–∞ of the probe substrate alone(reference). The precision for the comparison of interest wasestimated, using a sample size of 16 subjects and based on thelargest average estimate of within-subject variability (%CVw)for the CYP450 substrates to be studied (28.0 % forrosuvastatin AUC0–∞; GlaxoSmithKline, data on file). Pointestimates and corresponding 90 % confidence intervals (CIs)were constructed for the differences between the mean of thetest and reference treatments (the comparison of interest). Theestimated precision is no more than 19 % of the observedpoint estimate, where precision is expressed as the half-widthof the 90 % CI. For a point estimate of one, the corresponding90 % CI for the ratio of geometric means would be 0.84–1.19.This calculation was based on the loge-scale and a two-tailedprocedure with a type I error rate of 10 %. A total of 24subjects were enrolled to ensure 16 patients would completethe study.A sensitivity analysis was to be conducted in the event thatthe %CVw estimates were greater than expected. For the%CVw in the upper range of 35 %, it was estimated that theprecision for the comparisons of interest would be no morethan 23 % of the observed point estimate (i.e., the 90 % CI forthe ratio of geometric means would be 0.81–1.23, with a pointestimate of one). This calculation was based on the loge-scaleand a two-tailed procedure with a Type I error rate of 10 %.Study populationThe ‘safety population’ consisted of all subjects who receivedat least one dose of study medication. The ‘PK population’included subjects in the ‘safety population’ with PK samplesadequate for calculation of PK parameters. The ‘day 5 and day10 population’ excluded subjects from the PK population whohad multiple PK samples collected on day 5 and day 10. The‘PGx population’ excluded subjects who were predicted to bepoor metabolisers or have potentially reduced transporteractivity based on genotyping.Midazolam 3 mgDay 2Day 3Day 4Day 5 through day 10Day 11Day 12Day 13Day 1439Pharmacokinetic analysisPlasma concentration time data for all probe substrates, vercirnonand metabolites were analysed by non-compartmental methodsusing WinNonlin® v5.3 (PharSight, a Certara Company, StLouis, MO).

Vercirnon accumulation followingrepeat dosing was determined by calculating the accumulationratio (Ro) for AUC0–τ and comparing the Cmax for day 10 withday 5. The ratio of metabolite AUC0–τ to vercirnon AUC0–τon day 5 and day 10 was calculated after converting theAUC0–τ values to appropriate molar units.Eur J Clin Pharmacol (2014) 70:37–45needed to be close to zero or the 90 % CI for the slope estimateneeded to include zero.SafetySafety and tolerability parameters were assessed by the measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, adverse event(AE) assessments and clinical laboratory tests. The twovercirnon metabolites (GSK2635622 and GSK2656694) wereassayed and the molar ratio of each metabolite to vercirnon(parent) concentrations were determined.Pharmacogenetic analysesStatistical analysisProbe assessmentThe potential effect of vercirnon on the probe substratesevaluated in this study was assessed by comparing the ratioof AUC0–∞ of the probe substrate with and without concomitant vercirnon. The primary endpoint for all probe substrates(except omeprazole) was the ratio of AUC0–∞ for each of theprobe substrates when administered with and without concomitant vercirnon. Due to the high inter- and intra-subjectvariability associated with omeprazole PK [12], its metabolite(5-OH-omeprazole) was also quantified in plasma and theratio of omeprazole metabolite to parent was calculated tonormalise for the variability associated with the absorptionand metabolism of omeprazole. The statistical endpoint foromeprazole was calculated from the AUC 0–∞ ratio ofmetabolite:parent, both with and without concomitantvercirnon. Following loge-transformation, the primary endpoints were separately analysed using a mixed-effects model.Treatment was fitted as a fixed effect and subject as a randomeffect. Point estimates and their associated 90 % CI wereconstructed for the ratios, by back transforming the respectivedifference between the treatment least squares (LS) means andthe associated 90 % CI.Vercirnon steady-state analysisTrough concentration (Cτ) samples collected from all 24subjects on study days 6–11 were used to assess attainmentof steady-state. Individual plasma vercirnon pre-dose concentrations were obtained and the mean (+ standard deviation [SD]) and median (range) were plotted andsummarised by day. A mixed-effects model with subjectas a random effect and day as a fixed effect was performedon the loge-transformed Cτ data. Day was treated as acontinuous variable in the model. Achievement of plasmavercirnon steady state was assessed by calculating the 90 %CI of the slope of the linear regression of pre-dose Cτ versusday. To claim steady state was reached, the slope estimateTo account for potential inter-patient variability as a result ofgenetic polymorphisms, exploratory PGx evaluations werealso conducted. Exploratory analyses included PK parametersin a sub-population of subjects who had no common geneticvariations in the CYP enzymes or BCRP/OATP1B1 transporters that could negatively impact their activity (the PGxpopulation). The ‘Affymetrix DMET-Plus’ genotyping array[13] was used to genotype common genetic variants inCYP3A4/3A5, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1)and ABCG2 (BCRP). Subjects carrying genetic variantswhich predicted poor metabolism or reduced activity for therespective CYP enzymes or transporters were excluded fromthe relevant exploratory PGx analysis, thereby creating subpopulations with fewer confounding factors.ResultsSubjectsA total of 24 subjects (23 males: 1 female) enrolled andcompleted the study. Subjects had a mean (±SD) age of33±10.6 years (range 19–54 years), weighed 78.7±12.8 kg(range 61.0–109.9 kg) and had a mean (±SD) BMI of25.68±2.77 kg/m2 (range 20.1–30.2 kg/m2). Sixteen subjects (67 %) were Caucasian or of European heritage and8 (33 %) were African-American or of African heritage.All 24 (100 %) subjects enrolled were included in the‘safety population’ and the ‘PK population’. The ‘day 5 andday 10 population’ consisted of six subjects whilst the ‘BCRPPGx’ and ‘OATP1B1 PGx’ populations consisted of 19 and22 subjects, respectively.PharmacokineticsProbe and treatment comparisonsThe plasma PK parameters for probe substrates midazolam,pioglitazone, omeprazole, 5-OH-omeprazole and rosuvastatin	14492	19124

PK parameters for each of the probesubstrates were similar irrespective of whether they were administered alone or in combination with vercirnon. AUC0–∞variability for each of the probe substrates are presented inTable 3. In the case of omeprazole, the % CVw for the AUC0–∞treatment comparison was 54.3 % (Table 3). The %CVw wasgreater than the 28 % used to estimate sample size and theprecision of the comparison of interest. However, using theplanned ratio of the 5-OH-omeprazole metabolite AUC0–∞ toomeprazole AUC0–∞, the %CVw was reduced to 13.7 %.The %CVw for AUC0–∞ for midazolam, pioglitazone,rosuvastatin and 5-OH-omeprazole:omeprazole, (with and without vercirnon) ranged from 11.6 % to 21.7 %.

When vercirnon was at steady-state (day 10), themean AUC 0–τ for the metabolites GSK2635622 andGSK2656694 averaged 1.1 % and 2.6 % of parent AUC0–τ,respectively. Based on the data from the six subjects in thisstudy, neither metabolite would be predicted to exceed 10 %of parent exposure.SafetyVercirnon, along with the four probe substrates, was welltolerated in the 24 subjects who completed all treatments overthe course of 14 days. There were no deaths, non-fatal seriousAEs, early withdrawals due to AEs or pregnancies. A total of43 post-treatment AEs were reported during the study. Themost frequent AE was somnolence, which was reported by 13subjects on 19 occasions. In all cases, subjects were beingtreated with either midazolam alone or a combination of midazolam and vercirnon. Eight gastrointestinal AEs (dyspepsia[n =3], nausea [n =2], and one each of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and gastro-oesophageal reflux) were reported by sevensubjects. Three of these AEs were classified as potentiallydrug-related by the investigator, though only two (abdominalpain, dyspepsia) were reported during treatment with vercirnonalone. Other non-gastrointestinal AEs that occurred in morethan one subject were headache (n =4), dizziness (n =2), andabnormal dreams (n =2). All AEs were classified as mild inintensity with the exception of two clinical chemistry laboratory AEs in one subject, which were judged by the investigatorto be of severe intensity, but unrelated to study treatment.

Additional information provided by the investigator confirmed that the subjectremained well and that the transaminase levels had returned tonormal over a few weeks.All AEs resolved by the end of the study and no otherclinically significant laboratory findings, haematology, vitalsigns, or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were observed.PharmacogeneticsPK analyses were performed for the BCRP andOATP1B1 transporter PGx sub-populations only, as nosubjects were predicted to be poor metabolisers basedon their CYP3A4/3A5, CYP2C8 or CYP2C19 genotype.An evaluation of PK endpoints in the BCRP (n =19)and OATP1B1 (n =22) PGx populations revealed no significant difference in PK outcomes compared with the overallstudy population. All geometric mean ratios were between0.98 and 1.01 and the 90 % CI were between 0.86 and 1.13.DiscussionAssessing potential drug–drug interactions is a key aspect inthe development of any pharmaceutical treatment, especiallyin the assessment of safety and effectiveness. The objective ofdrug–drug interaction studies is to determine the potential forinteractions and whether these may require dosage adjustments or additional therapeutic monitoring to maintain treatment efficacy and/or mitigate risk. Preclinical studies identified a potential interaction between vercirnon and CYP3A4,CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 activity with [I]/Ki ratios between0.1 and 1.0, which would require a follow-up clinical evaluation in line with the recommendations in the US Food andDrug Administration Guidance for Industry: Drug InteractionStudies [10], as well a potential interaction with the transporterproteins BCRP, OAT1B1, OAT1 and OAT3 (ChemoCentryxand GlaxoSmithKline, data on file). Since the in vitro resultswere similar, these studies did not help to prioritise the evaluation of clinical drug interactions. Given the number ofpotential interactions, this study was designed to utilise probesubstrates to evaluate the effect of vercirnon on the activity ofall the CYP enzymes and transporter proteins of interest inhealthy adult subjects.Ideally, selected probe substrates should be the most sensitive and specific substrates for the CYP enzymes or transportproteins under investigation. Midazolam and omeprazole arerecognised as sensitive probe substrates for CYP3A4 andCYP2C19, respectively: their AUC0–∞ values would beexpected to increase by 5-fold when co-administered with aknown CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 inhibitor. Pioglitazone wasused as the probe substrate for CYP2C8 instead of the moresensitive probe substrate repaglinide, because it has a lowerpotential for hypoglycaemia in healthy non-diabetic subjects,and because it is also a substrate for OATP1B1; in vitro studieshave shown that vercirnon has the potential to inhibitOATP1B1 transport proteins. CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are themain enzymes catalysing the transformation of pioglitazone. Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil(Ki = 69–75 μM), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, significantly increases pioglitazone AUC by 3.4-fold [14]. Coadministration with rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP2C8,decreases the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone by 54 % [15].However, co-administration of pioglitazone with ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, only increases pioglitazone by 34 %. For these reasons, pioglitazone was considereda suitable probe substrate for CYP2C8.	26479	30352
581	1	4	47	1	8	44Drug transport proteins affect the concentration of drugsand metabolites in various tissues and can have a significant effect on the safety profile of a drug. Rosuvastatin, anHMG-CoA reductase inhibitor indicated for the treatmentof hypercholesterolaemia, is recognised as a probe substratefor multiple transporters: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT3 andBCRP [11]. Rosuvastatin is actively transported into hepatocytes by OATP1B1, resulting in a high first-pass effect and alow bioavailability (∼20 %). Co-administration of cyclosporin, an inhibitor of OATP1B1, increased rosuvastatin AUC by7-fold [16]. A recent in vitro study suggested that the BCRPefflux transporter may also play a role in rosuvastatin disposition [17]. While rosuvastatin may not be able to identifywhich transporter protein vercirnon may affect, a negativeresult would rule out drug interaction due to several transporters and confirm rosuvastatin as an anti-cholesterol agentthat may be co-administered with vercirnon.Overall, administration of midazolam, pioglitazone, omeprazole, or rosuvastatin following repeat dosing of vercirnonhad no significant effect on the systemic exposure (AUC0–∞)of each probe. This indicates that vercirnon exerted no substantial clinical effect on the activity of CYP enzymesCYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C19 or on BCRP and OAT1B1transporter activity.In the case of omeprazole, the %CVw for the AUC0–∞treatment comparison was particularly high (54.3 %). Thiscould be an outlier effect, as one subject recorded the lowestexposure when receiving omeprazole alone, followed by oneof the highest exposures when he received omeprazole incombination with vercirnon. Additional statistical analysis,excluding this subject from the omeprazole analysis, reducedthe %CVw for omeprazole to 27.8 %. However, excludingthis subject did not have a substantial impact on the overallfindings. While safety and tolerability data were collected inthis study, it must be noted that the study was not powered toassess these outcomes, and any interpretation should be madewith caution. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggestthat short-term exposure to vercirnon appears to have afavourable safety and tolerability profile. This requires confirmation in future studies. In addition, although there is a lowpredicted potential for vercirnon to interact with other drugs,or vice versa, this study did not directly assess the interactionof vercirnon with current treatments for Crohn’s disease, suchas corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, and tumour necrosisfactor inhibitors. Vercirnon is a distinct class of compound tothese treatments, and so the potential for combination therapywarrants investigation in future studies.In conclusion, the results of this study confirm and extendthose from in vitro studies, demonstrating that vercirnon isunlikely to affect the clearance of other drugs metabolised byCYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 enzymes, or affect thetransport activity of BCRP or OATP1B1. This indicates thatEur J Clin Pharmacol (2014) 70:37–45there is a low risk of drug–drug interactions with repeat dosesof vercirnon, supporting its use in Phase III clinical trials.Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Robert Blum and thestaff at Buffalo Clinical Research Center (BCRC), Buffalo, NY, US fortheir support with the study; Beth Harris and Louise Drewett for assistancein analysing genetic outcomes; and Gary Bowers, Grant Generaux, and JoePolli for scientific consultation.

(liraglutide)Study procedures included a screening visit followed by a 2 4 week forced glimepiride titration up to 4mg/day prior to randomization. Subjects that were evaluated as being eligible at the screening visit wereto discontinue their usual and commence an open 2-week run-in period with forced titration ofglimepiride therapy increasing to 4 mg/day followed by a 2-week maintenance period. Subjects oncurrent glimepiride therapy could go through a modified titration period or advance directly to the 2-week maintenance period at the discretion of the investigator. The doses of glimepiride (open-label)could be reduced from 4 mg/day to 3 or 2 mg/day (minimum) after randomization in the event ofunacceptable hypoglycemia or other adverse events. Subjects who required less than 2 mg glimepiridewere discontinued from the trial (see Table 6.5).Figure 6.4 Procedures for Trial 1436forced titration of (louhle~biind follow-u glimepiride trial product?

Therefore, thisstudy?s 4 mg background glimepiride dose is appropriate. Because sulfonylureas have similarefficacy, results from this trial should also apply to patients using maintenance doses of othersulfonylureas.The protocol permitted an increase in glimepiride dosage within 3-6 weeks prior to the baselineHbA1c measurement. Improved glycemic control resulting from this regimen change would not befully reflected in the baseline HbA1c measurement (HbA1c represents glycemic control over theprior three months). This could lead to over-estimation of the within group primary ef?cacyvariable (change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint) in these patients because some of theimprovement in HbA1c during the double-blind treatment period would be attributable to therecent increase in glimepiride dosage. Therefore, the change in HbA1c should be reported relativeto placebo. The baseline value of HbA1c is really a reflection of the decreasing effects of OADSused prior to study entry and the increasing effects of glimepiride.50	131020	133595

Subjects and Methods: Sixteen healthy male or femaleCaucasians completed this double-blind, randomized, 2-fold crossover study. Silexan (160 mg) or placebo were administered once dailyfor 11 days. Additionally, on day 11 of both study periods, 150 mgcaffeine (CYP1A2), 125 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9), 20 mg omeprazole(CYP2C19), 30 mg dextromethorphan-HBr (CYP2D6), and 2 mgmidazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally. Formal interactionwas excluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the silexan overplacebo ratios for phenotyping metrics (primary: AUC0–t) was withina 0.70–1.43 range. Results: According to the AUC0–t comparisons,silexan had no relevant effect on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 activity.Secondary phenotyping metrics confirmed this result. Mean ratiosfor all omeprazole-derived metrics were close to unity. The 90% CIfor the AUC0–t ratio of omeprazole but not for omeprazole/5OH-omeprazole plasma ratio 3 hours post-dose or omeprazole/5OH-omeprazole AUC0–t ratio (secondary CYP2C19 metrics) wasabove the predefined threshold of 1.43, probably caused by theinherent high variability of omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Silexanand the phenotyping drugs were well tolerated. Repeated silexan(160 mg/day) administration has no clinically relevant inhibitory orinducing effects on the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes invivo.Introduction(Frye et al., 1997; Tucker et al., 2001; Christensen et al., 2003; Sharmaet al., 2004; Fuhr et al., 2007; Wohlfarth et al., 2012).The oral lavender oil preparation silexan (the active substance ofLASEA, W.

Pharmacokinetic studies performed with silexandemonstrate a rapid absorption and elimination of linalool with anapparent elimination half-life (t1/2) of about 4 hours after a single doseand about 9 hours after 14 days of once daily administration (Kasperet al., 2010b).Information from traditional use of Lavandula angustifolia (e.g.,EMA community herbal monographs on L. angustifolia Miller, flos(European Medicines Agency, 2012a) and aetheroleum (EuropeanMedicines Agency, 2012b) and from limited in vitro tests conductedusing human hepatocytes does not suggest that silexan would interactwith cytochrome P450 enzymes (Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.KG, data on file). Because it is, however, questionable whether invitro drug-drug interaction studies with herbal drugs are predictive forin vivo interactions, the present clinical study was conducted toAssessing the potential of new drugs to change the activity ofenzymes and/or transporters involved in pharmacokinetic processesand thus to cause respective drug-drug interactions is an integral partof clinical development also for herbal medicines. To this end, actualactivity of many important drug-metabolizing enzymes in an individual may be quantified by phenotyping, i.e., by administrationof an appropriate substrate for a given enzyme and subsequent determination of pharmacokinetic parameters reflecting activity of thisenzyme (Fuhr et al., 2007). Phenotyping methods are extensively usedfor the qualitative and quantitative determination of factors influencingenzyme activity, including drug-drug interactions (Schellens et al.,1989; Adedoyin et al., 1998; Gorski et al., 2004; Zadoyan et al.,2012).

The study protocol was approved bythe Ethics Committee of the North Rhine Medical Association, Germany, andthe study carried out in accordance with German laws, the Declaration ofHelsinki, and other international guidelines. All study subjects provided writteninformed consent. Healthy male and female caucasians aged between 18 and 55years were included in a single center, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, two-period crossover design.In the test period, 160 mg silexan (one soft gelatin capsule) was administeredorally once daily on days 1–11. This preparation contains 160 mg of anessential oil produced from L. angustifolia flowers by steam distillation. Itcomplies with the monograph Lavender oil (Lavandulae aetheroleum) of theEuropean Pharmacopeia (Council of Europe, 2008) with respect to all qualityparameters. According to these specifications, required contents are 20–45%and 25–46% for linalool and linalyl acetate, respectively. In the referenceperiod, placebo capsules were administered instead. For each drug intake, thevolunteers reported to the study ward.In both study periods, administrations on day 11 were performed togetherwith the five-probe phenotyping cocktail. The volunteers were hospitalized 12hours before cocktail administration until 24 hours thereafter. Solid oralpreparations of four cocktail drugs [150 mg caffeine (three tablets ofPercoffedrinol N; Lindopharm GmbH, Germany), 125 mg tolbutamide (onequarter of a tablet, to be weighed; Actavis UK Limited, UK), 20 mg omeprazole(one tablet Omeprazol-ratiopharm NT 20 mg; ratiopharm GmbH, Germany),and 30 mg dextromethorphan-HBr (one capsule Hustenstiller ratiopharm;ratiopharm GmbH, Germany)] were administered orally together with silexanor placebo to evaluate the in vivo CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 activities,respectively. For the assessment of the total (liver and intestine) CYP3A4activity, 2 mg midazolam [2 ml taken orally with 120 ml of water (Dormicum Vinjection solution 5 mg/5ml; Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany)]were administered 1 minute thereafter.Intake of food and beverages was standardized for the in-house phase. Onday 11, the fasting period lasted from at least 9 hours before until 6 hours afterdosing, and fluid intake regularization was applied from 1 hour before until 6hours after dosing. During the ambulant periods (days 1–10 in both studyperiods and the washout phase of 21 days between cocktail administrations),nonalcoholic and noncaffeinated food and beverages without quinine or grapefruitcould be consumed ad libitum. Alcohol and grapefruit juice were prohibitedfrom 1 week prior to the study until the follow up examination performed 4–10days after last dosing.From 1 hour before administration of phenotyping cocktail until 4 hourspost-dose, subjects remained in a recumbent position, which was continuouslysupervised by study personnel.The study subjects were closely surveyed throughout the study for evidenceof clinical or laboratory adverse events (AEs).Blood Sampling. In both study periods, blood (10 ml per sample) for thedetermination of constituents of silexan was sampled approximately 10 minutesprior to the 5th, 10th, and 11th dosing to quantify exposure. The blood sampleswere collected into Sarstedt Monovette citrate tubes (Sarstedt AG and Co.,Nümbrecht, Germany) and then centrifuged (2000g, room temperature, 10minutes). The resulting plasma was transferred into two polypropylene tubes,immediately frozen, and stored in a freezer at –20° or below until assayed.For determination of the phenotyping substances and calculation of theprimary phenotyping metrics (Table 1), 9-ml blood samples were drawn approximately 10 minutes prior to dosing and 10, 20, 30, 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-dose. For determination of secondaryphenotyping metrics (Table 2) with the purpose of further validation of thephenotyping results, additional blood sampling was carried out approximately 10minutes prior to dosing and 3 and 6 hours post-dose. The blood samples werecollected into Sarstedt Monovette lithium heparin tubes, immediately cooledin ice water, and then centrifuged (2000g, +4°C, 10 minutes).

Linearcorrelation was used to assess the relationship between primary and secondaryphenotyping parameters.Sample Size Determination. Intraindividual CVs were assumed not toexceed 25% for any phenotyping metric (Fuhr et al., 2007). Lack of interactionwas assumed if the 90% CI for estimated ratio mtest/mreference did not exceeda tolerance zone of 0.70–1.43 for phenotyping metrics. For 0.95 # true ratiomtest/mreference # 1.05, N = 14 would allow rejection of each null hypothesis“interaction present” with a = 0.05 (two-sided) and a power of at least 90%.Two additional subjects were included to account for eventual drop-outs asa safety margin, resulting in a sample size of N = 16.ResultsDemographic Data. In total, 17 white Caucasian subjects (8 males,9 females) participated in this study. The respective means and rangesfor age and body mass index were 37 (21–52) years and 23.5(19.7–26.9) kg/m2. All subjects were nonsmokers at the time of thestudy, three subjects (17.6%) had smoked in the past. Six of the femalesubjects used oral contraceptives prior to and during the study. Allsubjects were healthy as confirmed by an extensive prestudy examination. After completion of the first study period, one subjectwithdrew due to AEs. Sixteen subjects completed the study and wereincluded in the analysis.Concentrations of Linalool and Linalyl Acetate in Plasma.Following administration of silexan, concentrations of linalyl acetatewere unquantifiably low (,2 ng/ml) in all samples, whereas thepresence of linalool (concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 9.0 ng/ml,LLOQ 2 ng/ml) confirmed compliance in all cases. Mean values forthe linalool concentrations were 2.02 ng/ml, 3.30 ng/ml, and 2.95 ng/mlprior to the 5th, 10th, and 11th dose of silexan, respectively, indicatingthat steady state has been reached on the phenotyping day.Identification of Genotypes Coding for Absent ProteinExpression. One study subject was identified as a poor metabolizerfor CYP2D6 and was excluded from the analysis of interaction for thisenzyme. With respect to the CYP2C19 genotype, no carriers of twoalleles coding for nonfunctional enzyme were identified in the studypopulation.Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Phenotyping Substrates.Concentration-time profiles of phenotyping drugs are shown in Fig. 1.Phenotyping metrics of the P450 substrates calculated followingadministration of the test and reference treatments are presented inTables 1 and 2. A summary of the statistical analysis, i.e., pointestimates and 90% CIs, on the effect of silexan on phenotypingmetrics is provided in Table 3.Downloaded from dmd.aspetjournals.org at ASPET Journals on October 21, 2014plasma was transferred into four polypropylene tubes, immediately frozen, andstored deep-frozen at a temperature below –65°C.At the eligibility assessment, blood was drawn for genotyping into SarstedtMonovette EDTA tubes. Genotyping was performed to identify individualswith two important nonfunctional alleles of CYP2C19 (*2, *3) and/or CYP2D6(*3, *4, *5, *6) (see http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/) with an approximategenotype frequency of 1 and 7%, respectively, in the Caucasian population.Such subjects were excluded from analyses for the respective metric becauseany interaction with regard to a specific enzyme cannot occur in its absence.Analytical Methods. The quantification of phenotyping substrates (caffeine,tolbutamide, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam) in plasma wasperformed using specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem massspectrometry methods as described earlier (Kasel et al., 2002; Jetter et al., 2004;Tomalik-Scharte et al., 2005; Frank et al., 2007; for specific details, seeZadoyan et al., 2012).For the silexan constituents linalool (3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-ol) andlinalyl acetate (3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-yl acetate), samples were analyzed by headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electronionization mode using a headspace autosampler G1888 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), gas chromatograph 7890A (Agilent Technologies;from 80°C to 230°C with 10°C/min, helium, flow 1.5 ml/min), mass selectivedetector 5975C (Agilent Technologies), software MSDCHEM Station(Agilent Technologies), and a capillary column (J&W) DB WAXetr (60 m Â0.32 mm, 0.5 mm; Agilent Technologies). Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was usedas solvent for test and calibration solutions. Extraction and purification ofreference substances was done in-house by Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.KG, Karlsruhe, Germany, achieving 97.6% purity of linalool and 97.7% purityfor linalyl acetate. Quantification of both substances was performed by linearregression with the primary reference standard linalool (ion 93.1 m/z) andinternal standard. Lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for linalool and linalylacetate was 2 ng/ml, working range was 2–2000 ng/ml. Interday precision forlinalool was between 0.1 and 7.0% and for linalyl acetate between 0.4 and12.0%, with interday accuracy between –6.0 and 1.6%, and –7.2 and 5.6%,respectively.Data Analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters of phenotyping drugs weredetermined from actual blood sampling times (relative to drug administration)for post-dose samples, and assayed drug plasma concentrations at these timesusing standard noncompartmental methods (WinNonlin Professional, version5.2; Pharsight Corporation, Palo Alto, CA).Plasma concentrations and all phenotyping metrics were assumed to arisefrom a log-normal distribution (multiplicative model).For all probe substances of the cocktail, the main phenotyping metric wasthe area under the plasma concentration-time curve between administration andtime of last quantifiable concentration (AUC0–t) of the parent compound(Tables 1 and 2). The treatments were compared using standard averagebioequivalence procedures (Steinijans et al., 1996) for the respective phenotypingmetrics (Tables 1 and 2) obtained following silexan (test) and placebo (reference)treatments. There was no adjustment for multiple comparisons because all	12219	19425

Median plasma concentration-time profiles of the phenotyping drugs insilexan and placebo periods. Values below respective LLOQ are not shown.Median tmax of a CYP1A2 probe drug caffeine occurred later aftersilexan (0.76 hour) than after placebo (0.55 hour) administration.Mean AUC0–t of the CYP2C19 probe substrate omeprazole wasslightly increased after treatment with silexan (1164 hours*nM)compared with the value observed after placebo treatment (1018hours*nM). For the CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam, mean t1/2was shorter after silexan administration (3.53 hours) compared withplacebo administration (4.33 hours).Phenotyping Metrics and Effect of Silexan on the Activity ofP450 Enzymes. For CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 metrics, the 90%CIs for the ratios (silexan/placebo) of the primary and secondaryphenotyping metrics were well within the predefined acceptance rangeof 0.70–1.43 (Table 3). Thus, a pharmacokinetic interaction betweensilexan and drugs which are substrates of these enzymes could beexcluded.The upper bound of the 90% CI for the AUC0–t ratio of theCYP2C19 probe substrate omeprazole was above the threshold of1.43, while the respective values for secondary phenotyping metrics(molar omeprazole/5-OH-omepazole plasma concentration ratio 3 hourspost-dose and molar omeprazole/5-OH-omepazole AUC0–t ratio) werewithin the acceptance range. Point estimates for the ratios silexan/placebo of all CYP2C19 metrics used were close to unity (Table 3).Marked heterogeneity of measurements with respect to the AUC0–t,AUC0–‘, and Cmax values for all omeprazole metrics used was observed.The exceeding of the acceptance range for the main phenotyping metricof omeprazole thus is probably caused by the inherent high variability ofomeprazole pharmacokinetics. Therefore, a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between silexan and CYP2C19 substrates is notexpected.In general, secondary phenotyping metrics provided similar resultsas the primary ones with regard to a potential interaction. Intraindividual variability of secondary phenotyping metrics depended on thetype of metric and on phenotyping drug and could be lower or higherthan for the primary metric (Table 3). Correlations between the mainand the secondary phenotyping metrics, calculated to provide furtherinformation for the use of simplified phenotyping strategies, weresignificant (P , 0.05) in all cases (Table 4).Safety and Tolerability. Eleven AEs were observed in 5/16(31.3%) subjects and 30 AEs in 15/17 (88.2%) subjects during anduntil 7 days after last placebo or silexan administration.Mild eructation occurred shortly after drug intake and was the mostfrequently reported AE, which was experienced by 10 (58.8%)subjects (in five subjects as a single event) after treatment with silexanand by no subject after placebo.With respect to the double-blind treatment, the causal relationshipwith silexan was considered as probable for five AEs (five cases ofeructation, silexan), as possible for eight AEs [eructation (five cases,silexan), diarrhea (one case, silexan), nausea (one case each, silexanand placebo)], and as unlikely for 27 AEs.With respect to the phenotyping cocktail, the causal relationship wasconsidered as possible for three AEs (nausea, dizziness, and vomiting)in two subjects and as unlikely for three AEs (cold, increased hematocrit, and increased erythrocytes count) in two subjects.No severe or serious AEs occurred during the study. One subjectdropped out due to moderate AEs (nausea before intake of study drugand vomiting after administration of the phenotyping cocktail) in thestudy period with silexan treatment.Mean vital signs, ECG, and laboratory parameters showed noclinically relevant changes during the study.Thus, repeated administration of silexan (160 mg/day) alone ortogether with the probe substrates were well tolerated by healthysubjects in this study.	19426	23808

The study using state-of-the-artmethodology showed that repeated administration of silexan has noclinically relevant inhibitory or inducing effects toward the CYP1A2,2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 enzymes.A higher silexan dose (160 mg/day) as compared with the standarddose of 80 mg/day was chosen in the study to maximize exposure inthe present drug interaction study (European Medicines Agency,2012c; Food and Drug Administration, 2012).Plasma concentration measurements of the silexan constituents(linalool and linalyl acetate) confirm the compliance of study subjects.Based on linalool concentration data, it could be concluded that theinteraction potential of silexan was assessed under steady-state conditions. Plasma concentrations of linalyl acetate below LLOQ can beexplained by the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound (rapidelimination) and the time point of sampling.The current pharmacokinetic approach allowed the effects ofsilexan toward major P450 enzymes to be examined systematically,simultaneously, and under standardized conditions. For scientificreasons and in line with existing guidelines on drug interactions(European Medicines Agency, 2012c; Food and Drug Administration,2012), a crossover design of the study was chosen as the within-subjectvariability was expected to be smaller than the between-subjectvariability. Based on the a priori estimation of the sample sizerequired, the number of study participants turned out to be sufficientfor all enzymes except CYP2C19, although intraindividual variability for several phenotyping metrics was higher than expected(Table 3).The probe drugs were selected in accordance with existingguidelines (Food and Drug Administration, 2012; European MedicinesAgency, 2012c) and scientific literature (Gorski et al., 2004; Franket al., 2007; Fuhr et al., 2007; Wohlfarth et al., 2012). All of thesedrugs are established probe substrates meeting the important criteriafor cocktail drugs: selectivity toward the respective P450s (i.e., theprobe drug is cleared predominantly by a single P450 enzyme),absence of interference with the metabolism and clearance of otherdrugs in the cocktail, safety and good tolerability, availability andvalidity of bioanalytical assays, and appropriateness of phenotypingmetrics. Selectivity of these substrates for respective P450s is supported by a number of investigations; following single doses, they donot affect the in vivo activity of any other of the enzymes to a relevantextent and no mutual interactions by their coadministration has beenreported (Endres et al., 1996; Frye et al., 1997; Streetman et al., 2000;Wang et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2001; Fuhr et al., 2007; Turpault et al.,2009). There is, however, a caveat for CYP2C19 phenotyping. TheEMA Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions (EuropeanMedicines Agency, 2012c) considers omeprazole as not sufficientlyvalidated as a phenotyping drug, but accepts its use as a “standard ofTABLE 4Correlation of secondary phenotyping metrics to the primary metric AUC0–t of the parent substanceSilexan TreatmentCYPnrd0.531*160.698**1615b0.842**0.697**16160.928**0.539*1615c0.905**0.971**1615c0.771**0.983**160.933**160.855**n1A22C92C192D63A4aMolar paraxanthine / caffeine plasma concentration ratio6 h post-doseaTolbutamide plasma concentration 24 h post-doseMolar omeprazole/5-OH-omepazole plasma concentration ratio3 h post-doseMolar omeprazole/5-OH-omepazole AUC0–t ratioMolar dextromethorphan/dextrorphan plasma concentrationratio 3 h post-doseMidazolam plasma concentration 6 h post-doser16For calculation of this correlation, the inverse value (i.e., caffeine/paraxanthine ratio) was used.Concentration in one subject in the silexan period was below LLOQ.One subject excluded because identified as genetically poor metabolizer.dPearson’s correlation coefficient.*P = 0.05; **P = 0.01.bcPlacebo TreatmentSecondary MetricdDownloaded from dmd.aspetjournals.org at ASPET Journals on October 21, 2014Discussion	23809	29326

An intraindividual comparison of the ratio foromeprazole revealed that in 6 of 16 volunteers the ratio AUC-silexanto AUC-placebo was $1.25, but in five volunteers it was below one.The group of the six volunteers with ratios $1.25 showed the lowestmedian of their AUC values after placebo treatment and individualratios $1.25 were observed only for low omeprazole AUCs underplacebo. Ratios $1.25 are primarily caused by particularly low AUCsafter placebo and not by high AUCs after silexan. The terminalelimination half-life of omeprazole was not affected by silexan. Forthese reasons, most probably the high variability and not an inhibitoryeffect of silexan on CYP2C19 is the explanation for the observations.Repeated administration of silexan 160 mg/day was well toleratedwhen given alone and together with the phenotyping cocktail. MostAEs observed in this trial (eructation, nausea) were expected (SmPCfor LASEA; NN, 2010), their nature and intensity were in line withpreviously reported data to silexan safety and tolerability profile(Kasper et al., 2010a; Kasper et al., 2010b; Woelk and Schläfke,2010). Also, the phenotyping cocktail used in the study is consideredto be safe and well-tolerated taking into account that the phenotypingsubstances have been widely used for various therapeutic applicationsin patients, their doses in the present study were reduced as far aspossible compared with the therapeutic doses by the application ofhighly sensitive analytical methods, only two single doses of eachdrug were administered for phenotyping, and available reports ofcocktail interactions studies confirm their appropriate safety and goodtolerability (Frye et al., 1997; Streetman et al., 2000; Wang et al.,2001; Zhu et al., 2001; Tomalik-Scharte et al., 2005; Turpault et al.,2009; Zadoyan et al., 2012).The use of a crossover design with well controlled conditions,including supervised intake of study drug, the clinically relevant doseof the drug to be tested, proof of exposure, and standardized food andfluid intake for assessment of enzyme activity may be considered asstate of the art and is stipulated by the respective guidelines (Food andDrug Administration, 2012; European Medicines Agency, 2012c).The data also suggest that the use of simplified phenotyping metricsshould take absorption properties of the phenotyping drugs intoaccount.In conclusion, the study reported here provides information to the invivo interaction potential of silexan at therapeutic doses toward majorP450s as well as further data to respective phenotyping metrics.Repeated oral administration of the standardized lavender oil preparation silexan at the dose 160 mg/day does not cause clinicallyrelevant inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19,2D6, and 3A4 enzymes.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Günther Pabst for conducting the pharmacokineticanalyses, and Julia Stingl for conducting the genotyping analyses.Authorship ContributionsParticipated in research design: Klement, Dienel, Fuhr.Conducted experiments: Lück, Fuhr.Performed data analysis: Doroshyenko, Rokitta, Zadoyan, Schläfke, Lück.Wrote or contributed to the writing of the manuscript: Doroshyenko,Rokitta, Zadoyan, Klement, Gramatté, Lück, Fuhr.ReferencesAdedoyin A, Frye RF, Mauro K, and Branch RA (1998) Chloroquine modulation of specificmetabolizing enzymes activities: investigation with selective five drug cocktail.

Irrespective of the phenotyping drug, assessment of full concentration-time profile is also recommendedby the EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions(European Medicines Agency, 2012c), most probably because pharmacokinetic interactions other than those caused by modificationof enzyme activity could occur, such as delayed absorption, whichmay erroneously be attributed to changes in enzyme activity, if onlya sample would be available. Still, phenotyping metrics based onsingle-point plasma concentration and molar metabolic ratios(Tables 1 and 2) are appealing, and suitability of such (secondary)phenotyping metrics had been previously assessed in cocktailinteraction studies (Jetter et al., 2004; Frank et al., 2007; Fuhr et al.,2007; Zadoyan et al., 2012) and were also assessed in the presentstudy. Intraindividual variability of secondary phenotyping metrics(Table 3) obviously depended on the type of metric and on gastrointestinal absorption of the phenotyping drug. For single pointmeasurements of the parent drug only (tolbutamide, midazolam), itwas higher than that for AUC0–t. For single-point metabolic ratios,variability was lower for drugs with poor and irregular bioavailability(omeprazole, dextromethorphan), but higher for caffeine, which israpidly and completely absorbed and does not undergo first-passmetabolism. The molar AUC ratio, combining an assessment based onmany samples (thus leveling out inaccuracies) and on standardizationwith regard to absorption differences, had the lowest variability ofthe CYP2C19 metrics tested. Both similar results with regard to theinteraction tested and the close correlations between most of thephenotyping metrics (Table 4) support the use of such phenotypingmetrics, with preference on metrics with lower variability, explainedby avoiding confounders.A clinically relevant effect of a perpetrator drug on the activity ofa given enzyme is difficult to define and depends on the victim drug.For the purpose of this study, formally interaction was excluded ifthe 90% CI for the ratios active treatment over placebo was within a0.7–1.43 range. These boundaries have often been used to assess drugdrug interactions (Steinijans et al., 1996; Rani and Pargal, 2004;Tomalik-Scharte et al., 2005; Fuhr et al., 2007).The upper bound of the 90% CI for the AUC0–t ratio of omeprazole(a CYP2C19 probe substrate) was above the threshold of 1.43 withthe mean AUC0–t ratio close to unity. Assuming this to reflect a realeffect of silexan on CYP2C19 activity, an inhibitory action of silexanon CYP2C19 cannot be excluded formally. For the assessment ofrelevance, however, it has to be considered that: 1) as shown previously by genotype/phenotype relationships, omeprazole clearanceis primarily mediated by the CYP2C19 activity, and the enzymeactivity itself is highly variable (Аndersson et al., 1993; Chang et al.,1995; Roh et al., 1996); 2) the inability to formally exclude aninteraction toward CYP2C19 was observed only for the most variable(albeit primary) of the three phenotyping metrics applied; 3) asdescribed above, the main phenotyping metric (AUC of parentcompound) is not fully validated (Fuhr et al., 2007; EuropeanMedicines Agency, 2012c); 4) other factors may contribute for a highinter- and intraindividual variability of the omeprazole-derivedCYP2C19 metrics. Specifically, omeprazole is acid labile and, therefore, is administered as acid-fast preparations dissolving in the smallintestine [Howden et al., 1984; Andersson et al., 1991; SmPC foromeprazol-ratiopharm NT, 20 mg hard capsule (NN, 2008); SmPC foromeprazole, 20 mg capsules (NN, 2012)], and the highly variable	29327	37101

Subjects who tolerated the ?naldose of rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) and metformin (2000 mg/day) were eligible for randomization after a6-week run-in period. Subjects who did not tolerate the ?nal dose were not randomized into the trial.Once randomized, all groups underwent a double-blinded forced titration period with liraglutide (activeor placebo) in order to achieve their ?nal doses. All subjects started on 0.6 mg liraglutide (active orplacebo). The dose was increased to 1.2 mg after one week. Subjects randomized to receive the highestdose had their dose of liraglutide (or placebo) increased to 1.8 mg/day one week later.Reviewer?s comment: The mandatory maintenance period with rosiglitazone 8 mg and metformin2000 mg prior to randomization was 6 weeks. Improved glycemic control resulting from this 6Week period would not be fully re?ected in the baseline HbA1c measurement (HbAlc representsglycemic control over the prior three months).- Figure 6.5 Procedures for Trial 157451	133596	136557

Reviewer?s comment: 11 subjects removed from a sample size of 746 would not be expected toalter ef?cacy results.Overall, 65.3% of subjects completed the trial (64.5% in the liraglutide 1.2 mg arm, theliraglutide 1.8 mg arm, and 61.3% in the glimepiride arm. The difference in completion rates seemed tobe based on a higher rate of therapeutic failure in the glimepiride arm. Early in the study, however,there was a higher withdrawal rate in the liraglutide groups compared with _glimepiride. For example,during month 1 the dropout rate was 24.7% in the lira 1.8 group, 25.8% in the lira 1.2 group, and 14.6%in the glimepiride group. The majority of the subjects in the liraglutide treatment groups that withdrewfrom the study early due to an adverse event, withdrew due to a gastrointestinal system related adverseevent. Details of withdrawals due to adverse events are discussed in detail in Dr. Mahoney?s ClinicalSafety Review. At 52 weeks, the discontinuation rate due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect was lowestfor the liraglutide 1.8 mg group intermediate for the liraglutide 1.2 mg group andhighest for the glimepiride group Reviewer?s comment: Handling of dropouts was addressed in Dr. Derr?s statistical review. PerDr. Derr there was no compromise of the efficacy assessment due to the somewhat high dropoutrate. It was also concluded that the lower and dose-dependent discontinuation due tounsatisfactory therapeutic effect in the liraglutide 1.8 mg groups was evidence for efficacy ofliraglutide.6.1.4. 1.3 Adequacy of comparator drug dosages used58	150248	152442

As expected the PP analysis set shows thegreatest ef?cacy for all groups.The -0.513% mean HbAlc reduction with glimepiride is lower than expected. For comparison, intwo 14-week placebo controlled studies in 720 subjects, the average net reduction in HbAlc forpatients treated with 8 mg Amaryl once daily was 2.0% compared with placebo-treated patients.(Amaryl label, 2005). Several possible explanations for the lower-than-expected response toglimepiride are differing trial populations, starting HbAlc levels, duration of diabetes, etc. Also,trial 1573 was not a placebo controlled trial, whereas the trial cited in the Amaryl label wasplacebo controlled.A plot of the mean HbAlc values over time by treatment for the ITT analysis set with LOCF ispresented in Figure 6.7.Figure 6.7 Trial 1573 Mean HbAlc Over Time by Treatment, ITT with LOCF61	155814	157600

Clinically, this suggests there may not be an importantdifference between 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg as monotherapy in the percent of patients reaching goals ofHbA1c lowering.The logistic regression did not exclude subjects who had HbA1c below target at baseline.However, the mean and range of HbA1c were similar among groups at baseline making theprobability that the groups were imbalanced at baseline for the percentage with HbA1c alreadybelow goal very small. 6.1.4.1.5.2 Change in HbA1c by Previous TreatmentThe Sponsor reports that previous treatment (diet/exercise versus monotherapy) indicated a greaterdecrease in HbA1c for subjects previously treated with diet and exercise in all treatment groups (Table6.16).

Therefore, this reviewer has concerns about a claim of greater efficacy inprevious diet/exercise treated patients being included in the product label. Also, the previouslytreated with monotherapy group had an insufficient washout period (see section 6.1.3.7 methodstrial 1573) so the lesser effect in the monotherapy group is possibly due to loss of effect from theprior agent. Another possible explanation for this ?nding is regression to the mean sinceglimepiride may also more effective among patients with previous diet/exercise therapy.6.1.4.1.5.3 Treatment effect on selected subgroupsFurther supplementary analyses of HbA1c were performed to investigate the treatment effect on selectedsubgroups. There was no reported notable effect on change in HbA1c due to country, gender, race,ethnicity, age (as a continuous variable), and BMI (as a continuous variable) (data not shown).Reviewer?s comment: Statistical power is too low to answer the questions regardingdemographics from individual trials.

This was similar to the result of change in HbA1c bybaseline HbA1c categories (HbA1c 5 9.5% and HbA1c Reviewer?s comment: This ?nding may re?ect regression to the mean and is commonly seen withother anti-diabetic medications.The inclusion of baseline body weight as covariate in the ANCOVA model used for analysis of HbA1cwas similar with respect to superiority of liraglutide to glimepiride for change in HbA1c as_ compared tothe analyses performed without baseline body weight as covariate. This result was similar when BMIwas used as a covariate in the ANCOVA model. A summary of change in HbA1c at the end of the studyby BMI subgroups indicates less change in HbA1c in the higher BMI subgroup for subjectstreated with liraglutide. .A summary of change in HbA1c at the end of the study by whether or not a subject had hypertension orhyperlipidemia indicates that these conditions had no impact on change in HbAlc during the study.61.4.1.7 Secondary e?icacy variables for the monotherapy populationFasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)All groups had a mean decrease in FPG from baseline to 52 weeks, with the greatest mean decreaseoccurring in the liraglutide 1.8 mg group (1.42 mmol/L); the liraglutide 1.2 mg group had a decrease of0.84 mmol/L, and the glimepiride group had the smallest decrease (0.29 mmol/L) (Table 6.17). Themean decreases in FPG values in the liraglutide groups were signi?cantly greater than in the glimepiridegroup, and the decrease in FPG was signi?cantly greater in the liraglutide 1.8 mg group compared withthe 1.2 mg group, as shown by ANCOVA analysis using the ITT population with both LOCF and noimputation. In conventional units, the mean decreases were 25.6 mg/dL for liraglutide 1.8 mg, 15.2 forliraglutide 1.2 mg, and 5.3 for glimepiride. As expected, for completers the decreases were greater at32.6, 17.2, and 7.2 mg/dL respectively for liraglutide 1.8 mg, liraglutide 1.2 mg, and glimepiride.Table 6.17Trial 1573 - ANCOVA of Change in FPG (mg/dL), (LOCF) ITT populationTreatment/comparison EstimatesLeast Square Means LS Mean SELira 1.8 230 -25.6 3.5Lira 1.2 234 -15.2 3.5Glimepiride 242 -5.3 3.3Estimated Treatment LS Mean 95% CI p?valueDifferences66	164841	167252

The spectrum showed the indicative characteristic fragmentions associated with the cleavage of the GSH moiety (Fig. 4B). The product ions atm/z 465 and 519 were derived from the neutral loss of -glutamyl portion (-129 Da)γand glycine portion (-75 Da) from parent ion m/z 594, respectively.To verify the characterization, IMP was chemically oxidized by oxone in acetone,followed by reaction with GSH. As expected, the product responsible for the IMPderived GSH conjugate showed the same chromatographic behaviors and identicalmass spectrum (Fig. 4C) as that of the conjugate generated in the microsomalreactions (Fig. 4B). Unfortunately, we were unable to have enough amount of theproduct for NMR characterization, due to poor reaction yield. Furthermore, the otherportion of the reaction solution was mixed with sodium borohydride for reduction andthen analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A new peak at retention time of 6.7 min was observed(Fig. 5A), and the M+H]+ was m/z 596.2, 2 Da higher than that of the conjugate[observed before the reduction by sodium borohydride (Fig. 5B).P450 Enzymes Responsible for IMP Bioactivation. To determine which P450enzymes preferentially catalyze the oxidation of IMP, IMP was incubated withindividual recombinant human P450 enzymes, including CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9,2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, or 3A5 (0.1 M for each) in the presence of GSH as theμtrapping agent. The IMP-GSH conjugate was assessed in the incubation with CYPs1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, or 3A5.

Theadjusted mean reduction in postprandial glucose due to liraglutide 1.8 mg across all three daily mealswas 37.4 mg/dL using the ITT population with LOCF. The reduction was 40.7 mg/dL for completers.ANCOVA showed that liraglutide 1.8 mg was signi?cantly better at lowering mean post-prandialglucose than glimepiride (adjusted mean change -12.9 mg/dL, There were no othersigni?cantly different comparisons liraglutide 1.2 mg was not better than glimepiride and liraglutide1.8 mg was not better than liraglutide 1.2 mg).

This critical finding providesthe evidence that bioactivation of IMP took place in the active site of CYP2B6.The P is defined as the number of product molecules produced per inactivationevent and reflects the efficiency of the inactivator. The values of Ps reported inliteratures for mechanism-based inactivators of P450 enzymes vary from 2 (veryhighly efficient inactivators) to >1000 (inefficient) (Kent et al., 2001). Bergamottin, afuranocoumarin compound, was an efficient mechanism-based inactivator of CYPs2B6 and 3A5 with partition ratio of approximately 2 for CYP2B6 and 20 for CYP3A5, respectively (Lin et al., 2005). Therefore, IMP (P = 4) may be ranked as anefficient inactivator of CYP2B6.At time 0 min, decrease in enzyme activity was observed with the increasing ofthe concentrations of IMP applied. The observed enzyme inhibition may result fromreversible inhibition at the beginning of the incubation.Generation of reactive metabolites is a key step for mechanism-based enzymeinactivation. We hypothesized that IMP is metabolized to furanoepoxide intermediate2 (Scheme 1) or/and -ketoenal intermediate 3, and the -ketoenal is also suggested toγγbe generated by rearrangement of the furanoepoxide. To probe the hypothesis, wesearched for the electrophilic intermediates using GSH as a trapping agent. An IMPderived GSH conjugate in microsomal incubations with IMP was detected by LCMS/MS (Fig. 4D). The detected protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ matched themolecular weight of GSH conjugates 4-6 (Scheme 1).

Inother words, whether intermediate 2 or 3 was the primary metabolic intermediateremains unknown. We speculate that IMP was oxidized to the corresponding γketoenal/epoxide (on the furan rings), which chemically attacked the host enzyme toform covalent binding and the enzyme modification initiated the process of theenzyme inactivation.The bioactivation studies with individual recombinant enzymes demonstratedthat multiple P450 enzymes catalyzed the metabolism of IMP to the reactiveintermediate (Fig. 6). CYP1A2 was found to be the major enzyme responsible for thebioactivation of IMP. Whether IMP is a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP 1A2 isunder investigation.In summary, we have shown that IMP is characterized as a mechanism-basedinactivator of CYP2B6. A GSH conjugate derived from a -ketoenal intermediateγwas identified in microsomal incubations with IMP trapped with GSH.18	23426	24553

Additionally subjects were on backgroundtherapy of 1.5 2 metformin daily.Reviewer?s comment: Although the maximal allowed dose of glimepiride close to the maximally effective dose. Therefore, the dose of 4 mg qd is adequate. Thebackground metformin exposure was also adequate.6.1.4.2.3.2 Trial 1436The comparator in this study was rosiglitazone 4 mg qd. Additionally, subjects were on backgroundtherapy of 2-4 mg glimepiride qd. AReviewer?s comment: Rosiglitazone 8 mg qd is the maximal FDA approved dose. Therefore, inthis trial the highest proposed doses of liraglutide are being compared to the half maximal dose ofrosiglitazone calling into question the adequacy of the active comparator dosage in this trial. Thechoice of active comparator dose was based on manufacturer?s recommendations and theapproved doses at the time in the regions where the trial was conducted (21 non-U.S. sites). Thisexplains the difference in rosiglitazone doses between Trial 1436 (4 mg/day) and Trial 1574 (8mg/day) (The design of Trial 1574 is discussed in section 6.1.3.83) However, use of the full 8 mgper day dose of rosiglitazone is often limited in clinical practice by side effects such as edema andweight gain limiting the usefulness of the highest dose. Therefore, rosiglitazone 4 mg daily as acomparator may have real world signi?cance.Background glimepiride exposure was adequate.6.1.4. 2.4 Primary efficacy variable for the add-on with one OAD populationAnalyses of the changes in HbAlc from baseline to the end of the trials for liraglutide groups comparedwith placebo and active comparator groups (ITT with LOCF) for the add-on with one OAD populations are summarized in table 6.23. For the HbAl endpoint, analyses using the ITT population with LOCFand the PP population were consistent across studies, supporting robustness of results. Unless otherwisenoted, this section presents efficacy data using the ITT population with the LOCF method.77	189954	192055

In trial1436, liraglutide at doses of 1.2 and 1.8 mg in combination with.glimepiride was superior to treatmentwith glimepiride rosiglitazone, and liraglutide 0.6 mg in combination with glimepiride was non-inferior to glimepiride rosiglitazone.Reviewer?s comments: These trials support efficacy of liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg over placebowhen added to one OAD.Concerning clinical importance: The HbA1c reductions for the 1.2 and 1.8 mg doses were greaterthan 1% over placebo in both trials. Therefore, when added to one OAD liraglutide can beexpected to have an important clinical impact.Concerning dose selection: Both trials show liraglutide at the higher two doses outperforming the0.6 mg dose. However, the higher two doses seem roughly equally effective based on the HbA1c reduction relative to placebo in both trials. Note: among the 5 major efficacy trials reviewed inthis document, only the monotherapy trial showed liraglutide 1.8 mg to be superior to 1.2 mg.Concerning the active comparator arms: Liraglutide added to metformin was non-inferior toglimepiride added to metformin, and at the 0.6 mg dose liraglutide was worse thanglimepiride added to metformin. Liraglutide at both the 1.2 and 1.8 mg doses added toglimepiride was better than rosiglitazone added to glimepiride. However, the rosiglitazone dose inthis trial was only 4 mg qd. Therefore, one should be cautious in concluding that liraglutide issuperior to rosiglitazone given at the maximal FDA approved dose of 8 mg. Based on these twotrials, taking into account the dose selection of the active comparator rosiglitazone, this reviewerconcludes that liraglutide is at least non-inferior to both of the active comparators at an HbA1cmargin of 0.4% when added to one OAD.A plot of mean HbAl by treatment and week for the treatment groups for trial 1572 is shown in 6.10and for trial 1436 in figure 6.11. Overall, in the liraglutide and active comparator groups, the decrease inHbA1c was evident after 8-12 weeks of treatment in both trials.In trial ?1572 there was a decrease in mean HbA1c from baseline to 12 weeks of treatment in all 3liraglutide groups and in the glimepiride+metformin group. In the metformin group, HbA1c increasedfrom baseline to 8 weeks of treatment and then decreased to close to the baseline level at 12 weeks oftreatment. In the period from 12 weeks of treatment to end of treatment, mean HbAlc remainedessentially unchanged in all 5 treatment groups.79	194361	197501

(liraglutide)All analyses were performed using the ITT population with LOCP to test for signi?cant interactions.Treatment by Pre-Treatment InteractionIn both trials the decrease in HbAlc from baseline to end of treatment in all groups was greater in thosesubjects having received previous OAD monotherapy, representing an add-on scenario, compared withthose subjects having received previous OAD combination therapy, representing a switch scenario.Note: in the metformin group, there was a lowering in HbAlc in subjects having received OADmonotherapy, while there was an increase in HbAlc in subjects having received OAD combinationtherapy. -Reviewer?s comment: This ?nding may be due to inadequate washout of previous OAD. Further,in both trials, the differences between treatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc did notdepend on previous OAD therapy (non?signi?cant treatment by previous treatment interaction).Treatment by Country Interaction .For trial 1572, from the statistical analysis, differences between treatment groups with respect to changein HbAlc did not significantly depend on country (non-signi?cant treatment by country interaction).For trial 143 6, the difference between treatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc diddemonstrate a statistically significant country interaction, meaning that the differences betweentreatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc differed between the countries Reviewer?s comment: The primary analysis for the primary ef?cacy variable included country asa ?xed?effect in the model the effect of country was accounted for in the primary ef?cacyanalyses).Treatment by Gender Interaction There was no statistically signi?cant treatment by gender interaction on HbAlc in either trial.Treatment by Race InteractionFor trial 1572, differences between treatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc did notsigni?cantly depend on race (non-significant treatment by race interaction).For trial 1436, there was no apparent difference in change in HbAl from baseline to end of treatmentfor liraglutide among the different racial subgroups. The statistical analysis did, however, show asignificant HbAlctreatment by race interaction (p value was 0.0026), meaning that the differencesbetween treatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc differed between races.Reviewer?s comment: The statistical reviewer concluded that across the ?ve Phase 3 studies, theaverage HbAlc response to liraglutide was not consistently affected by race or ethnicity. Most ofthe p-values of the interactions of race/ethnicity with treatment group were greater than 0.1. Inthe opinion of the statistical reviewer, the few p-values that were less than 0.1 (such as in this case)84	203801	206586

From the statistical analysis, the differences betweentreatment groups with respect to change in HbAlc did not significantly depend on age group (non-significant treatment by age group interaction).Treatment by BMI Group InteractionThis analysis investigated whether there was an interaction between the effect of treatment group andthe effect of BMI group (BMI 25 25 kg/m2 2 BMI 30 kg/m2, 30 kg/m2 3 BMI 35 kg/m2 andBMI 2 35 kg/m2) on change in HbAlc. There was no statistically significant treatment by BMI groupinteraction on change in HbAlc in either trial.6.1.4.2.5.3 Selected Exploratory AnalysesRelationship between Renal and Hepatic Impairment and Change in HbAlc_To investigate whether renal or hepatic impairment had any in?uence on the treatment effects seen onchange in HbAl c, change in HbAlc was summarized by baseline creatinine level (re?ecting renalimpairment), by baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level and by baseline aspartateaminotransferase (AST) level (the latter two re?ecting hepatic impairment). The Sponsor noted that thedegree of impairment was limited as exclusion criteria restricted the entry of subj eets with significantimpairment. The differences between the treatment groups for change in HbAlc did not appear todepend on baseline creatinine, baseline ALT, or baseline AST status in either trial.Reviewer?s comment: This reviewer agrees with the Sponsor that these analyses are limitedbecause of the exclusion criteria. In addition the chosen measures of renal and hepaticimpairment are not optimal. Estimated glomular ?ltration rate (GFR) or creatinine clearance forassessment of renal impairment may have been a better choice. In terms of hepatic impairment,tests of function bilirubin, INR, etc.) may be more re?ective of hepatic impairment.patients with cirrhosis may have very little elevation in transaminases because little tissue isleft. However, in this trial which excluded patients with medical comorbidities such as cirrhosis,tests of function may not have been helpful.6. 1.4. 2.6 Secondary efficacy variables for the add-on with one OAD populationSecondary glycemic control parameters were changes in fasting plasma glucose and post-prandialplasma glucose.85	206587	209171

(liraglutide)Revieweris comment: The proposed label states that .The lower value of mg/dL appears to have come from trial 1436 at theliraglutide 0.6 mg dose. The upper value of .--mg/dL derives from trial 1574. The plots over timefor these two trials support the claim that the reduction in FPG occurs within 2 Weeks of startingtreatment. However, the type 1 error rate was not controlled and this was not prespecified as akey endpoint. Therefore, this information may not be appropriate for the product label. 6.l.4.2.6.2 Post-Prandial Plasma GlucoseANCOVA analyses for the change in mean postprandial glucose are presented in table 6.27.Post-prandial glucose was patient-measured by glucometer 90 minutes after the start of each meal. Thevalues measured at each of the three daily meals were averaged to obtain the mean post-prandial glucosevalue. In both trials, there was a dose-dependent reduction in estimated mean post-prandial plasmaglucose across all 3 dose levels of liraglutide.Liraglutide vs. placebo: In both trials, liraglutide at all doses was better than placebo when added to oneOAD at reducing mean post-prandial glucose, although the decrease was smaller in the liraglutide 0.6mg groups.Liraglutide vs. comparator: For liraglutide in combination with metformin compared with glimepiridemetformin (trial 1572), the reduction in mean post-prandial plasma glucose did not differ from theactive comparator for the higher doses of liraglutide. Liraglutide at 0.6 mg was worse than the activecomparator arm. In trial 1436, the mean reduction in post-prandial plasma glucose values wassigni?cantly greater in the liraglutide 1.8 mg+g1imepiride and liraglutide 1.2 mg+glimepiride treatmentgroups compared to those in the rosiglitazone+g1imepiride treatment group. The liraglutide 0.6mg+glimepiride group was comparable to the rosiglitazone+g1imepiride group.Table 6.27ANCOVA of Change in Mean Postprandial (PostP) Glucose (mg/dL) (add?on therapy with one OADtrials)Placebo #ComparatorBaselinePostPglucose *Adjusted Mean Meanun- mean change difference difference .adjusted in PostP from com- from com- mean glucose (SE) parator 95% CI value parator 95% CI value89are	213414	215660

Liraglutide 1.2 mg metformin and liraglutide 1.8 mg metformin were shown to be superior to placebo metformin in trial1572. The liraglutide glimepiride groups were not better than placebo glimepiride in trial 1436.Reviewer?s comment: It appears that for both trials the possible reason the change in body weightfor all three liraglutide groups were shown to be superior to the active comparator was becausethe active comparator groups experienced weight gain, although in trial 1572, the weight loss withliraglutide was greater than the weight gain with the comparator glimepiride. The weightdifference between the liraglutide groups compared to the placebo groups in both trials wasclinically trivial (although statistically signi?cant for the two higher liraglutide doses in trial 1572).These results suggest that although liraglutide per se may not result in a clinically importantweight loss, the relative weight decrease compared with the active comparators in these trials(glimepiride and rosiglitazone both known to be associated with weight gain) may be clinicallymeaningful when choosing a particular drug therapy for an individual patient.Table 6.28ANCOVA of Change in Body Weight after 26 weeks (kg) (add-on therapy with one OAD trials)Placebo #ComparatorBaselineBodyWeightun- *Adjusted Mean Meanadjusted mean change difference differencemean in body from com- from com- (SD) weight (SE) parator 95% CI value parator 95% CI valueTrial 1572Metformin add-onLira 0.6 242 87.8 -1.78 (0.23) -0.28 -1.15; 0.60 0.8198 -2.73 -3.47; 2.00 <.0001(17.1)Lira 1.2 236 88.5 -2.58 (0.24) -1.07 -1.94; - 0.0117 -3.53 -4.27; 2.79 (19.1) 0.19Lira 1.8 241 88.0 -2.79 (0.23) -1.29 -2.16; 0.41 0.0016 -3.75 -4.48; 3.01 <.0001(16.3) -Placebo 121 91.0 -1.51 (0.31)(17.0) .Comparator 237 89.0 0.95?

Even though there was a slight decrease in weight in theliraglutide 1.8 mg group, these weight changes are probably not clinically meaningful.Further statistical analyses showed that-differences between treatment groups with respect to change inbody weight did not signi?cantly depend on BMI group (non-signi?cant treatment by BMI groupinteraction) for trial 1572, while the effect of baseline BMI on change in body weight was dependent ontreatment group (p=0.023 3) in trial 1436 with the greater BMI groups bene?ting from the greatestweight loss. Also, because nausea was a common side effect of liraglutide, the change in body weightwas evaluated for 6 different nausea subgroups; there was no consistent pattern with respect to therelation between nausea and change in body weight for either trial.6.1.4.2.6.4 Measures of beta-cell function and insulin resistance94	222046	223326

The statistically signi?cant difference found between the active comparator andliraglutide in trial 1572 has as much to do with a SBP increase in the comparator group. While areduction in blood pressure was seen, it was seen among placebo groups as well, suggesting thatthe blood pressure reduction was not related to liraglutide use per se. Alternative explanation arethat subjects enrolled in clinical trials may have better monitoring and treatment of comorbiditiessuch as blood pressure, or that subjects enrolled in clinical trials are more health conscious diet and exercise) that may promote lower blood pressure.

(liraglutide)6.1.4.3 Combination therapy population with two OADS (Trials 1574 and 1697)Both Trials 1574 and 1697 evaluated 26 weeks of treatment with liraglutide in combination with twoOADS. In Trial 1574 the OADS were metformin rosiglitazone, in Trial 1697 glimepiride metformin.Trial 1574 assessed two liraglutide dose levels; 1.2 and 1.8 mg and compared these with placebo (thetwo OADs alone). Trial 1697 assessed the 1.8 mg liraglutide dose and compared this with placebo (thetwo OADS alone) and with insulin glargine the two OADS).6.1.4. Demographic features of the add-on with two OADS populationA summary of screening characteristics and demographics for trials 1574 and 1697 is presented in Table6.30. In trial 1574, thebaseline demographic parameters were similar between treatment groups exceptin the sex category where the three groups appeared imbalanced. For trial 1697, the trialpopulation in all 3 groups was well matched with only small differences in baseline characteristics,again most notably in the category of sex where the trial population had a somewhat higherrepresentation of male subjects in the liraglutide 1.8 mg+OADs and glargine+OADs groups compared tothe OADS alone group. -Reviewer?s comment: There was not a signi?cant sex by HbA1c interaction in analyses of theprimary efficacy variable. See section 6.1.4.3.5.2There were some notable differences between the two trials. Subjects in trial 1697 appear to be older, have a mean duration of diabetes longer, and a mean HbAl higher than trialsubjects in trial 1574. Mean BMI was higher in trial 1574. Also a higher percentage of subjectshad been using OAD combination therapy prior to participation in the trial than usedcombination therapy in trial 1574. Racial distribution was also somewhat different between the trialswith Black subjects representing a smaller proportion in trial 1697 with 15.7% of subjects categorized asAsian or Paci?c Islanders.Reviewer?s comment: Within each trial randomization seems successful for the most part.Comparing between trials, overall, trial 1697 enrolled older and more advanced diabetics.In trial 1697, there were a small number of African Americans which is unlike the U.S. diabeticpopulation. 98	230990	233279

The number of withdrawals was highest during the first month, with a steadydecrease throughout the trial for the liraglutide groups. Most of the withdrawals due to AEs in theliraglutide groups occurred in the first two months.In trial 1697, the largest percentage of withdrawals occurred in the OADs alone group primarily due toineffective therapy. The liraglutide 1.8 mg+OADs group had a withdrawal rate of 10.8% with the mainreasons being adverse events and ?other reasons?. In the glargine+OADs group, the main reasons forwithdrawal were adverse events and non-compliance with the protocol. Overall, 30.5% of thewithdrawals occurred within the ?rst month.

614	1	4	50	1	4	DMD#60558IntroductionImperatorin (IMP), a linear furanocoumarin compound, is the major activeingredient in many common umbelliferous herbs used as traditional Chinesemedicines, such as Cnidium monniericuss and Angelica dahurica (Li and Chen, 2004;Baek et al., 2000). The IMP-containing herbs are widely used in China for thetreatment of osteoporosis and relief of swelling and pain (Zhang et al., 2003). Thereported pharmacological activities of IMP included anti-inflammatory property(Garcia-Argaez et al., 2000), anti-osteoporosis (Tang et al., 2008), antibacterialeffects (Rosselli et al., 2007), antitumor (Kim et al., 2007), -secretase inhibitionβ(Marumoto and Miyazawa, 2010), and inhibition of myocardial hypertrophy (Zhanget al., 2010). Recent studies demonstrated that IMP participated in hypertensiontreatment by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels and receptor-mediatedCa2+ influx and release (He et al., 2007). The observed multiple pharmacologicalactivities of IMP, along with its natural abundance, have shown a great potential to beused as a pharmaceutical agent.A number of furanocoumarin compounds have been found to be inhibitors ofcytochromeP450enzymes.6’,7’-Dihydroxybergamottinwasthefirstfuranocoumarin compound reported as an inhibitor of rat CYP3A subfamily (Edwardset al., 1996). Angelicin, isopimpinellin, 8-methoxypsoralen, psoralen, isopsoralen,bergamottin, and other related compounds in this family showed inhibitory effects onCYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5 (Baumgart et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2013; Linet al., 2005).In addition, several furanocoumarin compounds in umbelliferous4	2993	4616

However, thiscomparison may be useful for predicting ?real world? efficaciousness.103	242350	244707

We speculated that IMP may show similar irreversible inhibitoryeffect on CYP2B subfamily.CYP2B6 has been found in liver, brain, kidney, and heart in humans (Thum andBorlak, 2000; Miksys and Tyndale, 2004). Hepatic CYP2B6 content ranges from 2 to10% of total P450 content (Stresser and Kupfer, 1999). Human CYP2B6 has beenproven to be a very important metabolizing enzyme, and the enzyme is responsible forthe preferential metabolism of approximately 3 to 8% of widely used pharmaceuticals,such as buprokpion, methadone, ifosfamide, efavirenz, and cyclophosphamide(Faucette et al., 2000; Gerber et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2000; Ward et al., 2003). Todetermine the role of specific P450s in the clearance of various drugs and to preventdrug-drug interactions induced by the inhibition of P450s, prediction andidentification of compounds that act as mechanism-based inactivators of P450s havebecome an important issue in the drug discovery process.The objectives of the work were to investigate the mechanism-based inactivationof CYP2B6 by IMP, to characterize the reactive metabolites responsible for theenzyme inactivation, and to identify the P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolicactivation of IMP.5	4617	6004

Substrate protection from IMP-induced inactivation ofCYP2B6 was determined by incorporating ticlopidine (50, 100, and 200 μM) withIMP (1.5 M) in the primary reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated withμNADPH, and aliquots (40 L) of the mixtures containing 0.1 M CYP2B6 wereμμtransferred at 0, 3, and 9 min to the secondary incubation mixture for thedetermination of bupropion hydroxylase activities of CYP2B6. Control incubationswere performed in the absence of IMP or ticlopidine in parallel.Effects of GSH and Catalase/Superoxide Dismutase on the EnzymeInactivation. GSH (2.0 mM) was included in the primary reaction mixture containingCYP2B6 (0.1 M), IMP (1.5 M), and NADPH (1.0 mM). Aliquots (40 L) wereμμμtransferred to the secondary incubation mixture to determine the remaining enzymeactivities at various time points. Equal volume of phosphate buffer was added insteadof GSH solution as a control sample. In a separate study, CYP2B6 was incubatedwith IMP and NADPH in the presence or absence of a mixture of catalase andsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) (800 unit/mL for each). After incubation for 0, 3, and 9min, the residual activities were then detected as described below.Partition Ratio.

Unlike the add-on to one OAD trials, which showed nodecrease in SBP compared with the placebo groups, here trial 1574 does show a reduction in SBPcompared to placebo. However, these reductions are not dose dependent in trial 1574, and therewas only one dose of liraglutide tested in trial 1697 making an assessment of dose-dependencyimpossible. It is unclear why there is an inconsistency in the blood pressure results across thePhase 3 trials.

IMP (100 M) and GSH (1.0 mM)μwere incubated with RLMs (1.0 mg protein/mL) or individual human recombinantP450 enzymes, including CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, or 3A5(0.1 M for each) in the presence or absence of NADPH (1.0 mM) at 37 °C. Toμmaximize the quantity of the reactive intermediate to be formed, the enzymeincubations were conducted for 60 min. The resulting reactions were quenched bymixing with equal volume ice-cold acetonitrile containing hexyl glutathione asinternal standard, followed by vortexing and centrifuging. The supernatants wereharvested and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted with 50 μL of 50%acetonitrile in water and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The separation of GSH conjugateswas achieved on an Accuore C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm, ThermoFisher,Pittsburgh, PA). The solvent system consisted of mobile phase A (acetonitrile with0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (water with 0.1% formic acid), and the flowrate was set at 0.8 mL/min. The gradient elution was set as follow: 0-2.0 min, 10% A;2.0-8.0 min, 10-90% A; 8.0-10 min, 90% A; 10-13 min, 90-10% A; 13-15 min, 10%A.

The remaining CYP2B6 activity was monitored by measuring the amount ofhydroxybupropion produced.As shown in Fig. 1A, IMP produced a time- andconcentration-dependent inhibition on CYP2B6. The residual enzymatic activities at0 min were normalized to 100% at each concentration. The inactivation of CYP2B6increased progressively with increasing time and concentrations of IMP applied.About 70% of activity of CYP2B6 was suppressed after its incubation with 1.5 MμIMP for 9 min at 30 °C. Nevertheless, no loss of enzyme activity was observed in theabsence of IMP or NADPH (Fig. 1C).A double-reciprocal plot (Wilson’s plot) of the observed rates of inactivation(Kobs) and IMP concentrations was used to calculate the kinetic constants KI and kinact(Fig. 1B). KI was found to be 0.498 M, and kinact was 0.079 min-1.μSubstrate Protection. Substrate protection from IMP-dependent inactivation ofCYP2B6 was evaluated by including ticlopidine, a substrate of CYP2B6 (Talakad etal., 2011), in the primary incubations that contain CYP2B6 and IMP. The presence ofticlopidine was found to slow down the CYP2B6 inactivation induced by IMP (Fig. 2).In addition, the protective effect of ticlopidine increased with the increase in theconcentrations of ticlopidine applied.Effects of GSH and Catalase/Superoxide Dismutase on the EnzymeInactivation.

These datahave not yet been fully reviewed by the Division and therefore, these data were not used by thisreviewer in the decision to recommend approval. However, these data may be considered by signatoryauthorities for regulatory action because they provide some information about the potential role ofliraglutide in the anti-diabetes drug armamentarium.Important considerations and limitationsOne limitation of some of the phase 3 pivotal studies is the low enrollment of non-Caucasians,particularly blacks and Asians. These minority populations will likely make up a sizable segment of thereal world population treated with liraglutide because they are at higher risk for diabetes than120	270726	273696

Please seesection 5.3 for a discussion of exposure response relationships. The ?ndings discussed in that sectionsuggest that the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg doses will have similar ef?cacy in long-term trials and in fact, theefficacy review identi?ed very little difference between the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg dose in terms of theprimary ef?cacy endpoint HbA1c (see section 6). The question is then raised whether 1.2 mg wouldbe the appropriate maximal dose if liraglutide were to be approved. One consideration is the dose-toxicity relationship and the differential rate of adverse events between the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg dose (ifone exists); if the rate of adverse events were signi?cantly higher with the 1.8 mg dose one mightconsider only approving up -to 1.2 mg daily. (See section 7.4.2.1 in Dr. Mahoney?s safety review forexplorations for dose dependency of adverse reactions). From an ef?cacy standpoint, this reviewer agrees with the sponsor?s dosing recommendations becausein three of the four of the phase 3 ef?cacy trials that evaluated both the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg doses (trials1573, 1572, 1436) there was a greater proportion of subjects reaching glycemic targets of 7% and/or 56.5% with 1.8 mg. (In trial 1574 the proportions meeting targets were similarbetween the doses).However, if the Clinical Safety Review reveals signi?cant adverse events with the 1.8 mg dosecompared with the 1.2 mg dose, this reviewer believes that the 1.2 mg dose would be suf?cient.8.2 Drug-Drug InteractionsSee Dr. Mahoney?s safety review.8.3 Special PopulationsSpecial dosing considerations based on demographicsThere are no special dosing considerations based on demographics and diabetes disease characteristicsexcept that liraglutide has not been tested in the pediatric population and therefore, cannot berecommended for use in children at this time. See section 5.1 for a discussion of the pharmacokineticinvestigations in demographic subgroups which suggest that special dosing considerations are notwarranted. Comparison of the clinical ef?cacy of liraglutide in sub-populations was assessed throughstatistical testing of interaction between treatment effect and demographic and other intrinsic factors,based on data from the ?ve phase 3 trials 1573, 1572, 1436, 1574 and 1697. These analyses wereperformed in order to evaluate whether there were any subsets of the population that demonstrateddifferences with respect to the effectiveness, as measured by HbA1c, among treatments. Both data fromthe individual trials as well as pooled data from the four 26-weeks combination trials (Trials 1572, 1436,1574 and 1697) were assessed. Pooled analyses using all of the phase 3 studies took into account factorsof demographic differences between groups of subjects (gender, age, race, ethnicity, BMI and bodyweight), and disease (baseline HbA1c, duration of diabetes, previous anti-diabetic treatment (diet, oralantidiabetic drug monotherapy, or oral antidiabetic drug combination therapy). From an ef?cacystandpoint, there were no meaningful differences in ef?cacy across these variables that would affect thisproduct?s use. 1122	275504	278782

(liraglutide)Special dosing considerations based on renal and hepatic impairmentBased on clinical pharmacology data no dose adjustment is proposed for renal and hepatic impairmentsubjects (see section 5.1). The clinical ef?cacy review of the phase 3 program supports this conclusionto some extent (see caveat below). In order to assess whether disease-related factors in?uence theclinical ef?cacy of treatment with liraglutide, statistical tests were performed for interactions amongtreatment and disease factors either related to diabetes or resulting from comorbidities. Results from thetest for interaction among treatment and disease-related factors on glycemic control as measured byHbAlc by the end of 26 weeks of treatment (Trials 1572, 1436, 1574, 1697) and 52 weeks of treatment(Trial 1573) on the individual data and on the pooled data from the four 26-weeks combination therapytrials displayed no clinically relevant effect on any of the selected disease factors: serum albumin,creatinine or ALT. One caveat, however, is that although the clinical pharmacology program evaluatedsevere renal and hepatic impairment, the phase 3 clinical program excluded those patients. Exclusioncriteria for the phase 3 studies included impaired renal ?lnction, de?ned as serum creatinine 2125umol/L (21.4 mg/dL) for males and 2110 umol/L (21.24 mg/dL) for females (although renal functionbased on or Cockcroft-Gault or MDRD) often reveals that there are some patients withmild renal impairment in the studies) and impaired liver function, de?ned as alanine aminotransferase oraspartate aminotransferase 22.5 times upper limit of normal. The only therapeutic experience in patientswith moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30-59 ml/min) and severe renal impairment(creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min) comes from one clinical pharmacology study. In addition, thetherapeutic experience in patients with all degrees of hepatic impairment is currently limited againstemming from one clinical pharmacology study.Special dosing considerations in pregnancyThere are insufficient data for the use of liraglutide in pregnant and nursing women, and therefore,efficacy in pregnant and nursing women is unknown. However, there is no known reason why theefficacy in pregnancy would be different. The use of liraglutide in pregnancy is primarily a safety issue.8.4 PediatricsThe Sponsor has studied liraglutide in patients aged 18 years and older. In the United States, theprevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing substantially over the past decade in parallel with theobesity epidemic. Although originally considered a disease of middle- and older-aged people, type 2diabetes is being increasingly diagnosed in obese children. Therefore, liraglutide needs to undergotesting in children to comply with the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA). With the original NDAthe sponsor submitted a partial pediatric waiver for children below 10 years of age because pediatricstudies in this age group are impossible or highly impractical, and requested a deferral for older children.At the May 4, 2004 end?of-phase 2 meeting conducted under IND 61,040 between the sponsor and theAgency, the Division agreed that the sponsor?s plan to seek a waiver for subjects below years of ageand a deferral for older children was acceptable, provided regulations did not change by the time the initial NDA was submitted.

This agent produced little protective effecton the enzyme from inactivation. Additionally, a mixture of catalase and superoxidedismutase (SOD), scavengers of reactive oxygen species, showed little protectionagainst the inactivation of CYP2B6 by IMP, and the remaining enzyme activitieswere 29.7±1.0% (with catalase/SOD) and 29.9±2.4% (without catalase/SOD) at 9 min.Partition Ratio. The partition ratio (P), a measure of the efficiency of anenzyme inactivator, was estimated by a plot of the percentage remaining activity vsthe IMP/CYP2B6 molar ratio (Fig. 3), according to previously published method(Silverman, 1996). The turnover number (P+1) was about 5, and the extrapolatedpartition ratio of IMP was approximately 4 (Fig. 3).Irreversibility of inactivation. CYP2B6 was incubated with IMP (2.5 M) inμthe presence of NADPH, followed by 6 h dialysis (3 × 2 h).

625	1	4	50	1	15	DMD#60558DiscussionOur kinetic study clearly demonstrated that IMP produced a time-dependentinhibition of CYP2B6. The observed enzyme inactivation was also found to beconcentration-dependent, and it reached about 70% inactivation at the concentrationof 2.5 M. CYP2B6 inactivation induced by IMP was not observed unless NADPHμwas present in the primary incubation mixtures. This indicates that IMP itself is notan inactivator of CYP2B6 and that the enzyme inactivation by IMP needsbiotransformation with assistance of P450 cofactor NADPH. Taken together, theseresults provided strong evidence that IMP is a mechanism-based inactivator ofCYP2B6.Little protection by catalase and SOD against enzyme inactivation by IMP wasobserved. Catalase and SOD are known as enzymes quenching hydrogen peroxide,superoxide anion, and other reactive oxygen species that are possible agents toinactivate enzymes (Klaassen et al., 1986). The observed lacking of protection effectby catalase and SOD indicates that reactive oxygen species may not play a significantrole in CYP2B6 inactivation induced by IMP. Additionally, GSH, a nucleophilicagent, did not show protective effect on CYP2B6 inactivation by IMP. This impliesin part that CYP2B6 is covalently modified by electrophilic metabolites of IMPbefore escaping from the active site. The protective effect of ticlopidine on CYP2B6inactivation observed in the competition experiment indicates the competitionbetween ticlopidine and IMP to reach the active site of the enzyme, which slows15	18449	19970

169	1	2	16	1	146	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1.1 Recommendation on Regulatory ActionThe clinical safety reviewer does not recommend approval of liraglutide at this time, for tworeasons: 0 A strong signal in animals of C?cell tumors of the thyroid gland, with inadequate duration ofcontrolled study in humans to adequately assess the human risk, and0 Inadequate data to assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in humans.In the United States, there are already 11 classes of drugs approved for glycemic control in type2 diabetes, and one other in this class. The need for new therapies for type 2 diabetes is not sourgent that one must tolerate a signi?cant degree of uncertainty regarding serious risk concerns.Other safety concerns exist for liraglutide, but are not part of the basis for this recommendation.It should be noted that this reviewer conducted only the clinical safety review, and that thisrecommendation is made solely on the basis of safety information. The clinical efficacy reviewof liraglutide is ongoing by Dr. Lisa Yanoff. It is possible that signatory authorities, after havingconsidered ef?cacy information and all other available data regarding liraglutide, mayreasonably decide that the drug has an acceptable riskzbene?t ratio.1.2 Recommendation on Postmarketing Actions1.2.1 Risk Management ActivityNot applicable, as approval is not recommended.

(liraglutide injection)1.3 Summary of Clinical Findings1.3.1 Brief Overview of Clinical ProgramLiraglutide injection (Victoza?) is an analogue of human glucagon-like-peptide-l, intended forthe treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Native glucagon?like-peptide-1 is a gut incretinhormone which causes glucose-dependent secretion of insulin. The native hormone has a veryshort half-life, due to_ rapid degradation by dipeptidyl-peptidase-4. Liraglutide?s altered structurerenders it less susceptible to degradation, and thus prolongs its half-life. It is intended for oncedaily subcutaneous injection.At the time of NDA submission, there had been 38 completed trials of liraglutide. At the time ofthe 120-day safety update, liraglutide had been administered to 4430 patients for a total of 2434patient-years. Of these patients, 2412 had received liraglutide for 224 weeks, and 840 hadreceived it for 250 weeks.1.3.2 EfficacyPlease see Dr. Yanoffs clinical efficacy review.1.3.3 SafetyUp to the time of the safety update, there were 4 deaths among patients who had receivedliraglutide, and 3 deaths among patients who had received comparator. There was no evidenceof an association between liraglutide and overall mortality or cause?speci?c mortality.Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common among liraglutide-treated patients thanamong comparator-treated patients. This difference was primarily due to withdrawals due togastrointestinal adverse events. These withdrawals were primarily in the two higher dose groups(1.2 and 1.8 mg). The most common reason for withdrawal from the 0.6 mg dose group wasineffectiveness of therapy. All withdrawals due to injection site reactions and allwithdrawals due to hepatobiliary adverse events were among liraglutide-treated patients.For the clinical safety reviewer, there were two major safety concerns that affected approvability;inadequate data to assess the human risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma, and inadequate data toassess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.Medullary thyroid carcinoma and C-cell tumors are discussed in Sections 7.1.3.3.2 and 9.1.1. Inlifetime carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, liraglutide caused C-cell tumors in both species,in both genders, at clinically relevant exposures. In rats, adenomas and carcinomas occurred inboth genders at clinically relevant exposures. In mice, adenomas occurred at clinically relevantexposures, but carcinomas were seen only in females at high exposures. However, in rodents, C-cell adenomas are considered to be a precancerous lesion. There was a long latent periodbetween initial exposure and development of C-cell tumors. A similar signal is being noted ininterim carcinogenicity data for other long-acting glucagon-like-peptide-1 analogues. ln rodents,Page 5 of 249	300210	303094
171	1	2	16	1	148	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Muny Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 22341 Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)calcitonin may not have been a reliable biomarker for development of these tumors; in humans,serum calcitonin has historically served as a clinical marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma, thehuman form of C-cell carcinoma. Calcitonin physiology differs somewhat between rodents andhumans, and rodent thyroids may be more likely to contain glucagon-like-peptide-l receptors.The applicability of these rodent ?ndings to the risk of human medullary thyroid carcinoma isuncertain. In a meeting of the Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee, theCommittee voted 12 to I that the applicant had not established that the rodent C-cell tumor riskwas not relevant to humans.Medullary thyroid carcinoma is ordinarily a rare tumor, which occurs in sporadic and familialforms. No drug-induced forms have been described in humans. The described sporadic andfamilial forms are usually, although not always, indolent in terms of rate of growth. Althoughusually indolent in terms of rate of growth, the tumor can be aggressively invasive if notdiscovered in time for complete resection, and medullary thyroid carcinoma is considered to be amore serious form of thyroid cancer than the more common differentiated thyroid cancers. Earlycomplete surgical resection is currently the only curative option. Those who undergo completeresection usually survivesomething other than medullary thyroid cancer.However, the outcome for nonresectable cases is much worse, with a median survival of 3.2years, and with medullary thyroid cancer as the usual cause of death. In these patients, localneck invasion, with or other catastrophic local invasive process, is often the cause ofdeath.In the liraglutide program, there were no treatment?emergent cases of medullary thyroidcarcinoma, but one might not expect to see this relatively indolent tumor over the duration of thetypical drug development program.A total of ?ve liraglutide-treated patients and one comparator-treated patient had C-cellhyperplasia. These represent approximate rates per 1000 patient-years of 1.7 (5 cases/2882 PY)and 0.7 (1 case/1486 PY), respectively. There is controversy in the medical literature regardingwhether C-cell hyperplasia is a preneoplastic lesion in humans, and C-cell hyperplasia has beennoted at autopsy in some people who had no known thyroid disease prior to death.Calcitonin is a peptide hormone which is primarily by the C-cells of the thyroid.There are multiple stimuli for release, including calcium, several gut hormones, proton pumpinhibitors, and several disease states such as renal impairment. Historically, it was used as ascreening test for medullary thyroid cancer in relatives of patients with known medullary thyroidcancer; this use has largely been replaced by assays for speci?c genetic mutations known tooccur in the familial forms. Most patients with medullary thyroid cancer have marked elevationsof calcitonin, to over 50 ng/L, while the upper limit of normal is 5 ng/L for women and 8.4 ng/Lfor men. Serum calcitonin was measured in the major Phase 3 trials o_f liraglutide.In general, liraglutide did not cause marked changes in calcitonin levels. In the blindedcontrolled portions of trials (6 months in 4 trials and 1 year in ltrial), mean calcitonin valuesremained near the lower limit of quantitation. In voluntary unblinded extension studies out totwo years, mean calcitonin levels remained near the lower limit of quantitation, but dropout rateswere high and somewhat different between treatment groups. Patients who began study withPage 6 of 249	303095	306747
172	1	2	16	1	149	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)calcitonin elevations did not tend to develop progressive further increases in calcitonin over time.Among patients who began study with calcitonin values <50 ng/L, two liraglutide-treatedpatients and one comparator-treated patient developed calcitonin levels >50 ng/L (ratio However, liraglutide may have had some effect on calcitonin levels. From baseline to 26 weeks(the end of the blinded controlled portion of the trials), there was a dose-dependent trend forwomen to shift from below the lower limit of quantitation to within the range of quantitation.Also, from baseline to 26 weeks, the percentage of patients who had any upward category shift incalcitonin levels was highest, in both genders, for patients treated with the highest proposedliraglutide dose, 1.8 mg. At Week 12, for comparisons of all doses of liraglutide to activecontrol, and to placebo, mean percent changes in calcitonin values were statistically signi?cantlyhigher for liraglutide. At 26 weeks, this remained true for comparisons of liraglutide to placebo,and a dose dependent trend was noted for comparisons to both active control and placebo.However, mean values in these analyses were near the lower limit of quantitation. The incidenceof new elevations of calcitonin to >20 ng/L was numerically higher for liraglutide thanfor comparator and there appeared to be a dose?related trend. The highest percentage ofpatients who developed a new elevation of calcitonin to >20 ng/L was among patients in theliraglutide 1.8 mg group The clinical signi?cance of small changes in calcitonin in thissetting is uncertain.When asked whether the available data on thyroid C-cell tumors permit marketing of liraglutide,the Advisory Committee vote was 6 6 ?yes?, and ?abstain?.Most trials of liraglutide were 6 months or less in duration. Calcitonin data from voluntaryunblinded extensions of two trials are available for up to two years for approximately 500liraglutide-treated patients. In the clinical safety reviewer?s opinion, this duration of observationis not adequate to assess the human risk of this tumor, which may be relatively indolent in termsof expected rate of growth, but which can have very poor outcomes in unresectable cases. Theapplicant?s proposed labeling does not provide for monitoring with calcitonin, thyroidultrasound, or thyroid physical examination.Besides calcitonin, there are other potential biomarkers for medullary thyroid carcinoma,including procalcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen.Drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have the potential to be prescribed for millions ofpatients, and inadequately assessed safety problems can have signi?cant public healthconsequences. To address the de?ciency related to inadequate assessment of human medullarythyroid cancer risk for liraglutide, the clinical safety reviewer recommends a longer durationrandomized, controlled, blinded trial, that would include monitoring not only of calcitonin, but ofthese other biomarkers, with measurements at baseline and every three to six months. Theapplicant has already proposed a large cardiovascular outcomes trial which would includeapproximately 9000 patients. The clinical safety reviewer recommends that, in that trial, theapplicant measure these biomarkers as outlined, and perform an interim analysis of calcitonin,procalcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels at three years of study in this trial whenthe last enrolled patient has three years of follow-up). At three years of study, one would notexpect to see actual cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma, but the proposed analyses of multiplePage 7 of 249	306748	310461
173	1	2	16	1	150	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)biomarkers could provide a reasonable assessment of whether any degree of C-cell activation isgoing on. Three years is recommended because currently, there are limited data for calcitonin(and no data for other biomarkers) from voluntary unblinded extensions out to two years. Theseextensions had high dropout rates that differed between treatment groups. At the AdvisoryCommittee meeting, at which the applicant discussed calcitonin data out to two years, Dr.Burman (the Chairman of the Committee, and one of the two thyroid cancer experts on theCommittee) recommended a longer period of observation, and measurement of additionalbiomarkers. If there is no evidence of C-cell activation, even over three years of study, thiscould provide some level of comfort that the likelihood of induction of an aggressive form ofmedullary thyroid cancer by liraglutide would be small. With this information in hand, thepublic health consequences related to medullary thyroid cancer risk for liraglutide couldreasonably be expected to be relatively low.The second safety concern which, in the clinical safety reviewer?s opinion, affects approvabilityof liraglutide, is that of inadequate data to assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.In a recent Guidance, the Agency outlined requirements for sponsors of new diabetes drugs torule out unacceptably increased risk of cardiovascular events. There are multiple elements to theGuidance, but two relevant elements are inclusion in the development program of patients athigh risk for cardiovascular events (which permits accrual of sufficient events for analysis), andpremarket exclusion of a certain level of increased cardiovascular risk. Events of interest includea composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal_stroke. Theliraglutide NDA had already been submitted at the time of ?nalization of the Guidance, but theAgency has stated that it and other applications in the same circumstance must also meet therequirements of the Guidance.The liraglutide trials excluded patients with known cardiovascular disease, and event rates werevery low. In a composite of event terms deemed likely to represent true events of cardiovasculardeath, myocardial infarction or stroke, there were only 26 total events (liraglutide andcomparator combined) during the controlled, blinded portions of the trials, and only 23 of theseevents met the de?nition of a serious adverse event. In general, strati?ed analyses of liraglutideversus total comparator (active control plus placebo) did have point estimates which favoredliraglutide, and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of <1 .8, which was the prespeci?edupper boundary that could permit approval of a diabetes drug with a requirement for a largepostmarketing cardiovascular outcomes trial. The Guidance does not require applicants to meetspeci?ed con?dence interval boundaries for subgroup analyses. However, subgroups were?analyzed for consistency of the ?ndings. Analyses of liraglutide versus active comparator werequalitatively similar to those versus total comparator. Analyses of liraglutide versus placebo,however, were sensitive to analysis method, and sometimes had point estimates not favoringliraglutide, and upper bounds of 95% con?dence intervals which exceeded 1.8. The ?nding ofupper bounds that sometimes exceeded 1.8 can be attributed in large part, to very low eventrates. The ?nding of point estimates that sometimes exceeded 1 cannot be attributed to lowercardiovascular risk among placebo-treated patients, as these analyses were strati?ed by study,and baseline risk was similar between treatment arms in each of the included studies. Analyses?by baseline duration of diabetes (<10 years or 210 years) also showed point estimates andupper bounds >1 .8, for comparisons of liraglutide versus placebo, particularly when oneconsidered patients who had had diabetes for <l0 years at baseline. This was not an expectedPage 8 of 249	310462	314545
174	1	2	16	1	151	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)?nding, as the risk of cardiovascular events is generally thought to be higher in patients withdiabetes of longer duration, but very low event rates limited interpretability.In the Advisory Committee meeting, data regarding major adverse cardiovascular events werepresented to the panel, which included two cardiologists and a biostatistician, in addition toendocrinologists, an epidemiologist, a patient representative and a consumer representative. Thepanel?s overall vote was 8 ?yes? and 5 ?no? regarding whether the applicant had ruled out anunacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. However, both cardiologists and the biostatisticianvoted citing concerns about small numbers of events, low cardiovascular risk of the studiedpopulation, and the difference in results for analyses versus placebo. Other panel members,including some who voted ?yes?, also expressed concerns about the adequacy of the data.There are several other safety concerns for liraglutide, but, in the clinical safety reviewer?sopinion, these other issues, while potentially important, can be addressed through labeling and/orfuture studies, and do not rise to the level of approvability issues. They include:0 A numerical imbalance in cases of papillary thyroid cancer, not favoring liraglutide (6 casesversus 1; ratio Almost all of these cancers were <1 cm, and were discovered at surgerythat was prompted by routine protocol-speci?ed calcitonin or ultrasound screening. They arelikely incidental papillary microcarcinomata, which are common in the general population.However, ascertainment issues cannot fully explain the imbalance, because screeningoccurred for both liraglutide and comparator groups, and one would expect a similar rate ofincidental papillary cancers if this observation was entirely related to increased screening.0 Gastrointestinal adverse events, especially nausea, Vomiting and diarrhea. Rates ofwithdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse events were higher for liraglutide-treated patients.0 Pancreatitis. There were 8 events of pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients, and 1among comparator?treated patients (ratio One liraglutide-treated case was fatal,although there were confounding elements to this case. The comparator group patient, andfour of the liraglutide group patients, had risk factors for pancreatitis. Pancreatitis may be aclass effect for glucagon-like-peptide-1 analogues, given recent postmarketing reports forexenatide, for which final labeling discussions are ongoing.0. Serious neoplasm events. In the original New Drug Application, serious neoplasm eventsoccurred at rates of 8.9 versus 5.3 events per 1000 patient-years for liraglutide versus totalcomparator. After the 120-day safety update, these rates were 12.3 versus 8.1. After removalof serious but nonmalignant neoplasms, and papillary thyroid cancers, these rates were 10.3versus 8.1 events per 1000 patient years. No particular cancer cell type predominated. Therehave been recent concerns, based on epidemiologic data (some of which are con?icting), of apossible association between insulin and increased risk of malignancy. Liraglutide causes anincrease in insulin levels. This risk should be further assessed in future trials of liraglutide.0 Serious hypoglycemic events. In the major Phase 3 trials submitted with the NDA, all serioushypoglycemic events (defined as events requiring the assistance of another person) occurredamong liraglutide-treated patients, with none among comparator-treated patients. Six of these9 events occurred among patients concomitantly administered a sulfonylurea. The risk forthis may be similar between liraglutide and exenatide; in recent preliminary results of acomparative trial, two exenatide-treated patients and one liraglutide-treated patient hadserious hypoglycemic events.Page 9 of 249	314546	318479
175	1	2	16	1	152	Clinical Safety Review Karen Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 22341 Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)Injection site reactions were more common among liraglutide-treated patients than amongcomparator-treated patients, and liraglutide dose-dependency was noted.Antibodies to liraglutide developed in approximately 10% of liraglutide-treated patients, andantibodies which cross-reacted with native glucagon-like-peptide-1 developed in about 5% ofpatients. About l?2% of liraglutide-treated patients developed antibodies which had aneutralizing effect on liraglutide in an in vitro assay. Ef?cacy as measured by meanhemoglobin Al was not affected by antibody formation. The three liraglutide-treatedpatients with the highest antibody titres had almost no change in hemoglobin Alc over time,suggesting that those patients with the highest anti-liraglutide antibody titres may have somediminution in efficacy, but these three patients are too few upon which to base a conclusion.Antibody-positive patients were more likely to have events related to infections; most of thesewere nonserious nasopharyngeal or upper respiratory infections. Antibody-positive patientsalso had more events of musculoskeletal pain and of certain injection site adverse reactions.Immunogenicity events from standardized queries using the Medical Dictionary forRegulatory Activities were more common among liraglutide-treated patients than amongcomparator-treated patients. About 40% of immunogenicity-related events were urticariaevents.Slowing of gastric emptying, with effects on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. Theclinical significance of this effect is under discussion with the Clinical Pharmacology team.Overall thyroid neoplasms (19 versus 4 for liraglutide versus comparator; ratio 2.4: 1). Thesewere mostly thyroid nodules discovered after protocol-speci?ed screening.Hepatobiliary adverse events. Overall rates of hepatobiliary adverse events were similar forliraglutide and comparator, but all withdrawals due to hepatobiliary adverse events occurred among liraglutide-treated patients. A higher numerical percentage of liraglutide-treated patients had bilirubin levels above the upper limit of normal. There was no differencebetween liraglutide and comparator for transaminase elevations. No patients met the criteriafor Hy?s law.A small increase in heart rate of 2-3 beats per minute, and a numerical imbalance in adverseevents related to increased heart rate, not favoring liraglutide. A ?thorough QT study? did notshow evidence of a liraglutide-associated risk of QT prolongation.Risk of medication errors due to design and labeling of the pen injector for the 0.6 and 1.2 mgdoses. The applicant is submitting a new pen device to address these concems, and reviewsby the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls reviewer and the Devices reviewer areongoing.Potential for off-label use/abuse for weight loss. Liraglutide was associated with a smallamount of weight loss in clinical trials. Potential exists for off-label use in a non-diabeticpopulation that would not bene?t from 1iragIutide?s glucose-lowering effects, but could stillbe at risk for all its adverse effects.Animal fetal anomalies at exposures at or below that expected for the human clinical dose.Pregnancy Category is recommended.Nonserious adverse events of dizziness and fatigue.During the review cycle, there were some issues with data quality regarding laboratory reportingfor serum calcitonin, bilirubin and creatinine. There was a discrepancy regarding missingcalcitonin values, which the applicant attributed to programming errors. Two sets of errata weresubmitted. During the review of bilirubin and creatinine data, the clinical safety reviewer notedPage 10 of249	318480	322213
627	1	4	50	1	17	DMD#60558fragments valuable for metabolite identification (Fig. 4B). A fragment at m/z 162responsible for molecular formula of C9H6O3+ was detected, indicating that the 5member ring fused with the coumarin ring was opened (Scheme 1). This allows us toexclude the formation of GSH conjugate 4, since the ring opening of conjugate 4would produce a thio-ester. Only GSH conjugate 6 has the ring opening structure,and conjugate 5 could be spontaneously converted to conjugate 6.To furthercharacterize conjugate 6, we chemically reduced the conjugate with NaBH4. Thereduction reaction afforded a new product with retention time at 6.7 min and [M+H]+at m/z 596.2 (Fig. 5A), 2.0 Da higher than that of the one detected before thereduction reaction.The MS/MS spectrum of the reduced GSH conjugatedemonstrated that the fragment at m/z 162 was retained, indicating that no reductiontook place in the coumarin ring. In addition, the original IMP-GSH conjugate showeda fragment at m/z 177 that resulted from the elemental composition of C10H9O3+ of theconjugate losing the side chain, GSH, and CO2. In other words, fragment of m/z 177contained the aldehyde group (Fig. 4B). However, no such fragment was observed inthe MS/MS spectrum of the reduced IMP-GSH conjugate (Fig. 5B). Instead, thereduced IMP-GSH conjugate showed a fragment of m/z 179, 2 Da higher than that(m/z 177) observed in the MS/MS spectrum of the original IMP-GSH conjugate (Fig.5B). This provided the evidence that the reduction took place on the aldehyde not onthe lactone group. Additional experiment showed that IMP was resistant to thereduction by NaBH4 (data not shown). We anticipate that the NaBH4–based reductionof conjugate 6 gave conjugate 7. The observed conjugate 7 indicates that conjugate 617	21663	23425

Therefore, amedication which mimics would be expected to have the potential to lower blood glucoseonly when glucose is high, and not when it is normal or low. This is in contrast to some otheroral antidiabetic drugs, such as sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin secretion independently ofblood glucose levels, and are therefore associated with a risk of hypoglycemia. A lower risk forhypoglycemia is a potential advantage of this drug class. However, native has a veryshort half-life, due to almost instantaneous degradation via the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-4(DPP4). Approaches to the development of drugs which act via have focused on eitheraltering the structure of to make it resistant to degradation, or on inhibition of DPP4 activity. Liraglutide is an analogue of GLP-1, with a prolonged pharmacokinetic, (PK) pro?leintended for once daily subcutaneous (SQ) injection. The applicant states that liraglutide has anelimination half-life of 13 hours, and a duration of action of 24 hours.The proposed indication is: ?Liraglutide, a human analogue, is indicated as an adjunct todiet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.?Initiation at a dose of 0.6 mg SQ once daily is proposed, with titration to 1.2 mg SQ once dailyafter at least one week. Uptitration to 1.8 mg SQ once daily is possible after at least one week at1.2 mg/day.2.2 Currently Available Treatment for IndicationsPlease see Dr. Yanoff clinical ef?cacy review.2.3 Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United StatesPlease see Dr. Yanoffs clinical efficacy review.2.4 Important Issues With Pharmacologically Related ProductsThere is one approved analogue, exenatide (Byetta?). Clinical safety issues withexenatide include:0 gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea0 formation of anti-exenatide antibodies, some of which are neutralizing and may result inreduction in glycemic control response0 hypoglycemia, particularly when coadministered with a sulfonylurea0 altered renal function, such as increased serum creatinine and adverse events of renalimpairment Page 12 of 249	323989	326533

He recommendsapproval and does not have signi?cant concerns regarding CMC issues.The device reviewer, Dr. Syed, had some concerns in his review memorandum, which was 4)attached to Dr. Ri1ey?s second review (DF 17 Apr 2009). Novo had used their own .device, which they have used for insulin products, and modi?ed it to be used with liraglutide.0 The applicant had not provided the 5 10K ?number or an NDA number for their predicatedevice which was modi?ed to produce the liraglutide pen device.0 He felt that the color and marking changes on the device could confuse the user, and that aproper Human Factors study needed to be conducted to support the reasoning behind thesechanges, and their effectiveness.  Dr. Riley, the Microbiology reviewer, did not note Microbiology issues that would preclude approvability. The drug product is sterile and contains an (4)Dr. Riley?s review is in DFS (10 Mar 2009).3.2 Animal Pharmacology/ToxicologyIn his review (DFS 8 Jul 2009), Dr. Parola, the Pharmacology/Toxicology reviewer states thatthe application is not approvable from a Pharmacology/Toxicology standpoint because there isinsuf?cient nonclinical information about liraglutide to determine if it is safe for chronic use.His primary concern is the ?nding in 2-year lifetime exposure carcinogenicity studies in miceand rats that liraglutide caused thyroid C?cell tumors in both species, in both genders, atclinically relevant exposures. In rats, C-cell carcinomas occurred at clinically relevantexposures. In mice, only females developed carcinomas, and only at high multiples of expectedhuman exposure. However, in rodents, C-cell adenomas are considered to be a precarcinomatouslesion. A similar animal signal is being noted in interim carcinogenicity data for some otherlong-acting (q day and longer) analogues in development. In animal studies ofliraglutide, calcitonin (which has been used historically as a biomarker for medullary thyroidcancer in humans) may not have been a reliable biomarker for C-cell tumor risk. Dr. Parolastated that the mechanistic studies performed by the applicant did not mitigate this risk. Dr.Parola recommends that the applicant determine the mode of action for liraglutide-inducedrodent C-cell tumors. Determination of the mode of action could provide important informationto evaluate the potential human relevance of these rodent C-cell adenomas and carcinomas. Dr.Page 13 of 249	326534	329478
179	1	2	16	1	156	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission O00Victoza? (liraglutide injection)Parola suggests some possible animal studies which could provide further mode of actioninformation.Dr. Parola was also concerned that local toxicity after repeat subcutaneous injection had not beenadequately assessed in nonclinical studies. In chronic repeat dose toxicity studies, liraglutidecaused irreversible injection site reactions in monkeys, using drug formulations that were at least3 times more dilute than the clinical formulation. Liraglutide also caused fibrosarcornas in thedorsal skin and subcutis in mice in the high dose group in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. Dr.Parola states that these frbrosarcomas were attributable to local toxicity due to high drugconcentration at or near the injection site. The concentration of liraglutide in the high doseformulation in the mouse study was 0.6 mg/mL, which is 1/ 1 0m the concentration of the clinicalformulation (6 mg/mL).An additional concern was that some liraglutide impurities were not quali?ed in genetic toxicitystudies. Dr. Parola recommends evaluation of the in vitro genetic toxicity of liraglutideimpurities at impurity levels consistent with drug substance and drug product acceptance criteria.Dr. Parola recommends Pregnancy Category C. Liraglutide cause abnormalities in fetal rats atmaternal systemic exposures that were 0.8 times the expected human exposure from the 1.8 mgliraglutide dose. Liraglutide also caused major fetal malformations in rabbits at 0.2x humandose.4 DATA SOURCES, REVIEW STRATEGY, AND DATA INTEGRITY4.1 Sources of Clinical DataAs of the date of submission of the NDA (23 May 2008), the liraglutide development programconsisted of 38 completed clinical trials (data cutoff date 31 Jan 2008) and 2 ongoing controlledopen-label extension trials (data cutoff date 21 Feb 2008).The clinical safety review included review of pooled data from these trials, from a safety updatesubmitted by the applicant on 23 Sep 2008, from multiple other submissions containing liraglutide-related safety information, from the only approved GLP-1 analogue (Byetta?,exenatide injection), and from the medical literature. After submission of the original NDA, the applicant has forwarded 41 additional submissions tothe NDA. These submissions are discussed in Section 7.2.9.Throughout the NDA review period, the applicant continued to submit individual safety reports?to the IND (61040), which were also incorporated into the review.4.2 Tables of Clin_ical StudiesThe following table lists all studies included in the original NDA submission.Page 14 of 249	329479	332119

Approximately 4 months alter beginning liraglutide, the patient began to have"left-sided discomfort", but did not report it to a physician. The patient completed 117 days ofliraglutide treatment per protocol; he also received metformin (MET) and glimepiride (GLIM)during the study. Approximately two weeks after routine per-protocol discontinuation ofliraglutide, the patient felt a lump in his left side, and three weeks later saw a physician. At thattime, ultrasound revealed a 15 cm renal mass, and chest computerized tomography (CT) showeda suspicious node in the left mediastinum. One week after initial presentation, the patientunderwent a left radical nephrectomy for a Fuhrman Grade IV renal cell carcinoma. On anunknown date, a CT of the thorax and abdomen showed extensive hepatic, pulmonary andskeletal metastases. The patient's postoperative course is not otherwise mentioned in thenarrative, but he died 7 months postoperatively from his renal cancer. His last liraglutideexposure had been approximately 8.5 months prior to his death.Patient 225011 was a 63 year old man with a prior history of "hypersensitive bronchial tubes".The narrative states that he had not had alcohol for seven years prior to study entry, but does notPage 24 of 249	349780	352217

Approximately four months afterbeginning liraglutide, he presented with bronchitis and four days later, he washospitalized. Six days after hospitalization, he was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis andhepatocellular carcinoma. His presenting signs and/or were not mentioned in thenarrative, but during the hospitalization, he was found to have elevated transaminases andferritin. Five days after diagnosis of his liver cancer, liraglutide was discontinued. He had alsobeen taking concomitant metformin. He was discharged from the hospital; treatment for thishepatocellular carcinoma is not mentioned. He died approximately 10 months after diagnosis.Patient 9025 was a 63 year old woman with a prior medical history of hypertension andhyperlipidemia. Approximately 5 weeks after starting liraglutide, the patient experiencedabdominal enlargement, malaise and headache. The next day, vomiting and diarrhea began. Oneday later, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis. Thepatient was febrile and had an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, blood ureanitrogen, creatinine and creatine phosphokinase. Troponin and ECG were normal. Meropenemtrihydrate was initiated. The next morning, the patient was found in cardiorespiratory arrest.Resuscitation was attempted for two hours, but the patient did not respond. The investigatorstated that "the direct cause of death was airway obstruction as a result of vomiting". An autopsywas not done. In the clinical safety reviewer's opinion, the cause of death was more likely due toaspiration of vomitus with resultant respiratory and cardiac arrest, rather than to gastroenteritisper se. Had the patient not aspirated, recovery would have been likely (as in the vast majority ofcases of acute gastroenteritis), although the clinical course described for this patient was particularly severe (fever, leukocytosis and renal dysfunction at presentation). The possibility ofanother explanation for the patient's presentation exists, also, such as bowel infarction, whichmight have been expected to have a much more severe course, sometimes resulting in sepsisand/or hypotension with cardiovascular collapse and death. However, the paucity of data doesnot permit a determination of whether a different diagnosis was possible.Patient 689012 was a 67 year old woman with a prior medical history of hypertension,hyperlipidemia and nephrolithiasis. Approximately 2.5 months after starting control medications(glimepiride and metformin), the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with apulmonary embolism; presenting were not mentioned in the narrative. Five days afterpresentation, a stent was placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery; the reason forstent placement was not mentioned. The patient was hemodynamically unstable; stent occlusionwas suspected. Thrombolytic was administered and two more stents were placed. The patientnever regained hemodynamic stability, and remained hospitalized. Twelve days later, the patientsuffered an acute myocardial infarction with cardiorespiratory arrest and died. Autopsy was notperformed.Patient 827005 was a 54 year old man with a prior medical history of hypertension anddyslipidemia. After approximately 3.5 months on control medications (glargine, glimepiride andmetformin), the patient awoke at 0245 with chest pain, shortness of breath and sweating. Anambulance arrived within 5 minutes, but the patient died during transport to the hospital.Electrocardiogram during transport showed ?at line. Cause of death was listed as acutemyocardial infarction; autopsy was not performed.Page 25 of 249	352218	356035
191	1	2	16	1	168	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234! Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)Patient 504036 was a 57 year old woman with no prior medical history mentioned other thandiabetes mellitus. She received control medication (glimepiride) for 194 days. A relativenoti?ed the principal investigator that the patient had died in an automobile accident; thenarrative states that hypoglycemia was not suspected.Overall, deaths occurred at a low rate, and occurred with equal frequency among liraglutide- andcomparator-treated patients. There was no evidence of an association between liraglutide andoverall mortality or cause-speci?c mortality.In the 120-day safety update, an additional death was reported, with the cause of death beingacute pancreatitis. Patient 117006 was a 64 year old woman who received liraglutide 1.8 mg for668 days. She had no known history of alcohol consumption. Approximately 5 weeks prior toher death, she had undergone a colonoscopy which revealed a colonic polyp, whichwas suspicious for adenocarcinoma. Three days prior to her death, she underwent a repeatcolonoscopy, in order to ?re-biopsy the area and to determine the extent and need forinvasivesurgery?. No perforation appeared to occur, and endoscopic retrogradecholangiopancreatography was not performed. After the colonoscopy, the patient reportedabdominal pain, but two days later, she was reported to be active. The next day, she rapidlydeteriorated and died. Autopsy was reportedly consistent with acute and chronic pancreatitis.Macroscopic evaluation revealed mottled white, tan and dark red to black areas, ?with most ofthe lighter areas about the periphery?. Microscopic analysis revealed fatty change and autolysis.Autolysis was seen ?in a range of organs beyond the pancreas?. Gallbladder stones were present;biliary obstruction was not mentioned. The presence of dark red to black areas raised thequestion of whether this patient had necrotizing pancreatitis, and further information wasrequested from the applicant. On 29 Jun 2009, in an email to Dr. Parks (Division of Metabolismand Endocrinology Products Division Director), Dr. Thompson of Novo submitted areport of a pathology cons_ultation that was performed at Dartmouth by Dr. Daniel Longnecker.He had received 3 slides from the original autopsy, which had been performed in Florida. NovoNordisk had requested the consultation from Dr. Longnecker. In his blinded review of the slides,which he performed prior to knowledge of the original autopsy ?ndings, he did not identifypancreatic tissue. Some of the tissues on the slides were unidenti?able, with advanced autolysis.After examining the slides, he received the autopsy report. He concurred with the diagnosis ofacute pancreatitis based on the macroscopic description. He also stated ?The fact that pancreatictissue was not identi?ed in the blinded review of the autopsy slides is not surprising inasmuch asnecrosis is an expected ?nding in acute pancreatitis. In addition, the pancreas is known toundergo autolysis more rapidly than many other tissues because of its high content of hydrolyticdigestive enzymes. One can assume that one or more of the unidenti?ed tissues in the slidescame from the pancreas and was unidenti?able because of the combined effects of antemortemnecrosis and postmortem autolysis.? 07.1.2 Other Serious Adverse EventsIn general, serious adverse events occurred with similar frequency among liraglutide-treated andnon-liraglutide-treated patients across the development program.

This was a 60 year old Russian woman whopresented with dif?culty swallowing, facial and eyelid swelling, and a ?suffocation attack? afteradministration of Bioparox (fusafungine) for acute laryngopharyngitis. Fusafungine appears tobe an agent with local antibacterial action that is used for treatment of upper respiratoryinfections in some countries outside the United States. She had been taking liraglutide 1.2 mgfor 211 days prior to onset of the angioedema. She was hospitalized and treated with intravenousglucocorticoids and recovered. She was discharged from the hospital 9 days later; LGT wasnever discontinued. Patient 471040 was a 51 year old Finnish man who had an event of organizingpneumonia (COP). He presented with prolonged ?u-like and fatigue after 48 days ofLGT 0.6 mg/day. About two months prior to starting LGT, he had had a pneumonia. At thetime of presentation (Study Day 48), he had a left lung in?ltrate on chest X-ray, and wasadmitted to hospital. Computerized tomography and bronchoscopy con?rmed an organizingpneumonia of unknown etiology. He was discharged the next day. It appears that two weekslater, he had a high-resolution CT which showed a 4 cm diameter left lung in?ltrate;bronchoscopy showed ?a mild in?ammation?. One month later, LGT was discontinued due to?ineffective therapy?, and the patient was withdrawn from study. About two months later,prednisone was initiated. Two months later, he underwent mediastinoscopy which revealed onlymildly enlarged nodes. At that time, he was considered to be ?recovering?.Patient 504010 had an event of acute adrenocortical insufficiency. This was a 48 year oldMexican woman with a prior history of Cushing?s and bilateral adrenalectomy. Shepresented with malaise, fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after 2l3 days of liraglutide1.2 mg/day. She was hypotensive on presentation, and was treated with intravenoushydrocortisone, followed by oral prednisone. She also received cipro?oxacin. She wasdischarged two days later. Liraglutide was discontinued during the hospitalization, but wasresumed on discharge.Patient 516007 had an event of rheumatoid arthritis. This was a 62 year old Australian womanwith a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, who presented with worsening knee pain after 103days of liraglutide 0.6 mg/day. She was admitted, underwent knee arthroscopy to determine ifknee replacement was warranted, and was discharged 1 day later. Four days after thearthroscopy, she developed a knee infection, which was treated with cephalexin, and resolvedafter 7 days of treatment. The narrative states that knee replacement will be required at somepoint in the future.Patient 526011 had an event of myositis. This was a 45 year old South African woman whopresented with severe left thigh pain after 229 days of liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Eighteen days afterpresentation with thigh pain, she was admitted to the hospital. Magnetic resonance imagingrevealed ?increased signaling? of muscles in the anterior upper thigh. The narrative does notmention whether she had measurements of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) or in?ammatorymarkers. She was treated with antibiotics, vitamin B12, iron supplements, amitriptyline,cipro?oxacin, diclofenac and ?anti-in?ammatory medication?. She had a history of chronic irondeficiency anemia.

(liraglutide injection)Application for liraglutide, and thus would not have been able to prospectively design itsdevelopment program in the fashion described in the Guidance. However, evaluation of thecardiovascular risk of liraglutide is still necessary prior to approval, and the Agency has statedthat drugs with pending applications would still be expected to meet the standards of theguidance for reassurance regarding a lack of an overall increase in cardiovascular risk. To theextent possible, the clinical review of cardiovascular safety attempts to present data consistentwith the requirements of the Guidance. However, for liraglutide, it was not possible to followthe Guidance entirely for several reasons, including:0 Cardiovascular events were not prospectively adjudicated in the development program,and there were inadequate data to perform post hoc adjudication.0 A speci?c effort had not been made in the liraglutide development program to includepatients at high risk of cardiovascular events; in fact, patients with signi?cantcardiovascular disease were generally excluded.0 The overall Phase 2/3 development program was not designed to be combined into ameta-analysis. Trials were of varying durations, and the blinded and open-labelextension periods differed among major Phase 3 trials.0 Few major adverse cardiovascular events occurred.Therefore, the approach to evaluation of the cardiovascular risk of liraglutide had to be adaptedto the available data, which presented challenges.7 .1 .3.3.1 .2 Description of Types of Analyses and Summaries for Major Adverse CardiovascularEventsInitially, the Agency requested that Novo Nordisk, and the applicants for two other recent NewDrug Applications, submit analyses of an endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke andcardiovascular death. The applicants were allowed discretion in which (MedicalDictionary for Regulatory Activities) Preferred Terms were included in their endpoints. Theanalyses for liraglutide are presented in Section 3.3.1.4 below. However, upon comparison,it was noted that the component terms chosen by the applicants were quite different for the threeproducts. The types of data presentations also differed considerably. While realizing that thedevelopment programs were quite different from one another, and that cross?comparisons shouldnot be made between drugs, the Division felt that it would be useful for the Advisory Committeeand signatory authorities to see a similar type of information for each of the three drugs.Therefore, the Division made a ?uniform? information request of each of the applicants. Aprecisely identical format for data presentation is not possible for the three products, because thedevelopment programs differed in several ways, and cross-developrnent-program comparisonswould not be appropriate. However, the endpoints are uniform, and to the extent possible,similar analyses were presented for each product. The intention for each of the endpoints wasstill to provide an assessment of the incidence of the composite of cardiovascular death,myocardial infarction or stroke. Results of the ?uniform? analyses are presented in Section7.1 .3.3.l.3 below, and are likely the most useful for evaluation of the cardiovascular risk ofliraglutide. In the interest of completeness, Section 7.l.3.3.l.5 also presents data on allcardiovascular adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Thisprovides the reader with information on cardiovascular events other than myocardial infarction,stroke and cardiovascular death. Total mortality data are also presented in Section 7.1.1.Page 45 of 249	395704	399400

Terms in this endpoint were selected from events which actually occurred, ratherthan from a SMQ7.1 .3.3.1.3: ?Uniform MACE Analyses?Please refer to the Information Request (DF 11 Jan 2009) which was sent to each of theapplicants for the three products which had pending applications at the time of the diabetescardiovascular evaluation Guidance. The information request details what was requested forthese ?uniform? analyses.As mentioned earlier, when comparing MACE analyses initially submitted by differentapplicants, it was noted that the component Preferred Terms chosen by the applicants differedconsiderably, as did the analysis methods. Therefore, a group of three FDA Clinical Reviewerscollaborated to attempt to devise uniform endpoints for evaluation. This was not a simple task;there are many possible Preferred Terms which might be assigned when a patient has had amyocardial infarction or stroke. Post hoc adjudication of all events was not possible due toinadequate information. Therefore, a collection of Preferred Terms for myocardialinfarction and stroke, as originally coded, with the addition of cardiovascular deaths, seemed thebest approach. Two endpoints were chosen, one intended to broadly capture all possible strokesand myocardial infarctions; and one intended to include those terms which seemed likely to bechosen as the term to describe an event that truly was a myocardial infarction or a stroke. Thebroad endpoint used was the combination of the Broad Standard Queries formyocardial infarction and central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular accidents;and cardiovascular deaths (see Section 7.1.1). This is referred to as the ?Broad MACE The more speci?c endpoint, referred to as the Custom is a subset of the ?BroadMACE Without considering which events had actually occurred for a given product,each clinical reviewer independently reviewed the list of all possible terms included in the?Broad MACE The clinical reviewer then considered each term, with this question inmind: ?If I had a patient who actually had a myocardial infarction or a stroke, is this a PreferredTerm that I might actually have chosen for such an event??, with the goal of selecting only thosePreferred Terms that seemed highly likely to represent events that would truly be a myocardialinfarction or a stroke. The interest was also that these events likely represent acute events with amechanism of atherosclerotic plaque development followed by plaque rupture/thrombosis (asPage 50 of249	404944	408113

(liraglutide injection)opposed to events with nonatherosclerotic mechanisms, e.g. rupture of congenital aneurysma).The three reviewers? lists were compared, and any terms for which there was not unanimousagreement to include or exclude were open for discussion. Consensus was reached on whichterms were included. The clinical safety reviewer acknowledges that this is an imperfectprocess; other reasonable physicians may have chosen a different set of terms. Also, althoughthe SMQS are broad, they may not be all-inclusive. For example, the BroadMyocardial Infarction SMQ does not contain the terms ?cardiac arrest? or ?circulatory collapse?;?cardiac arrest? was a Preferred Term assigned for one patient exposed to LGT, and ?circulatorycollapse? was assigned for one patient each in the placebo and active comparator groups.However, the overall goal was to have a uniform, fairly speci?c endpoint for use with each of theagents, in order that the Advisory Committee and signatory authorities could see data that wereas similar as possible for each product. It should be noted that this endpoint is not a standardFDA endpoint and should not be presumed to be the Agency?s choice for future evaluations ofcardiovascular events. Please see Table 7.l.3.3.l .2 for an exact list of terms included in the?Broad MACE and the Custom endpoints.In addition to the above two endpoints requested by the FDA, the applicant also included anendpoint composed of cardiovascular death and the Narrow Standard Queries for?Myocardial Infarction? and ?Central Nervous System Haemorrhages and CerebrovascularAccidents?. This is a subset of the aforementioned ?Broad MACE This endpoint isreferred to as ?Narrow MACE and the included Preferred Terms are also listed in Table7.1.3.3.1.2.These analyses include all data from all Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, up to the 120-day safetyupdate submitted during the review cycle. The applicant included data both from their diabetesdevelopment program, and from their obesity development program. For pooled analyses, theapplicant obtained estimates and 95% con?dence intervals using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszelestimation with stratification by trial. Only the first MACE for each patient was counted in theanalyses.Summary tables follow which display these estimates, and the numbers of events which actuallyoccurred, for liraglutide versus comparator. In these tables, there are two time periodpopulations. Population A includes the randomized, controlled periods for all completed Phase 2and Phase 3 trials of LGT, up to collection of the primary efficacy endpoint. The Divisionconsiders Population A the primary population of interest. Population adds the controlled, butunblinded, voluntary extension periods (after collection of the primary endpoint) of Trials 1572and 1573. Exposure for these populations is as follows:Page 51 of 249	408114	411054

219	1	2	16	1	196	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission O00 Victoza? (liraglutide injection)Results From the Statistical Analysis of Major Adverse Cardiovascular EventsThe analyses that Novo conducted produced 12 point estimates with associated 95% con?denceintervals (CI). These 12 point estimates were obtained from the combination of three MACEendpoints (FDA Custom, SMQ Broad and SMQ Narrow), two types of events (all treatment-emergent adverse events and serious TEAE), both analysis populations A and B, andone estimation method. The analyses that Dr. Derr conducted produced 8 point estimates with95% Cls. These 8 point estimates were obtained from a combination of two MACE endpoints(FDA Custom and SMQ Broad), one type of event (TEAE), both analysis populations A and B,and two estimation methods.As these are presented, there are three important values to keep in mind. The point estimate ofthe risk for liraglutide versus comparator will be considered. Also presented is how the upperbound of the 95% con?dence interval for that point estimate falls with respect to theaforementioned boundary of 1.8, which is the boundary above which the cardiovascular risk evaluation guidance states that further study of cardiovascular events would be needed prior toapproval. Also considered is how the upper bound of the 95% con?dence interval falls withrespect to 1.3. In the guidance, products that have values >1.3 and <1.8 could be considered forapproval, but would require postmarketing study to provide further reassurance of cardiovascularsafety.Liraglutide versus Total Comparator (Placebo and Active Controls)The stratified analyses that Dr. Derr and Novo conducted were based on 15 studies, because all15 studies had either a placebo arm,? an active comparator arm or both arms. Based on Novo?sanalyses, all 12 point estimates for the incidence ratio of LGT versus total comparator were <the estimated upper 95% Cl bounds were with 1 being This?ndingis consistent with the estimates calculated by FDA using two other estimation procedures(Tables 7.1.3.3.1.3.9, 7.1.3.3.1.3.10, 7.1.3.3.1.3.11 and 7.1.3.3.1.3.12 for FDA Custom Mace andSMQ broad MACE, all TEAE and analysis populations A and B). All 8 of the FDA pointestimates were 1.0 and all 8 estimated upper 95% CI bounds were 1.8, with 3 being 1.3.Results were similar for different endpoints, time period populations, event seriousnessgroupings, and statistical analysis methods. For this reason Dr. Derr concluded that the estimatesfor liraglutide versus total comparator were not very sensitive to the choice of estimationmethodology.The number of actual events for the liraglutide and pooled comparator groups is summarized inTable 7.1 .3.3.1.3.3. Of note is the small number of relevant events that occurred in the overalldevelopment program. For the FDA Custom MACE endpoint (all treatment-emergent events,Pop A), there were only 26 events, only 23 of which met the regulatory de?nition of a seriousadverse event. For the analysis with the most events (Broad SMQ MACE, all TEAE, Pop B),there were 114 events, of which 44 were serious adverse events (SAES).Page 54 of249	417835	420989
220	1	2	16	1	197	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Murry Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 2234] Submission O00Victoza? (liraglutide injection)Liraglutide versus Placebo ControlThe cardiovascular risk guidance does not require that applicants meet the speci?ed boundariesfor subgroups. However, subgroups were examined, as an assessment of consistency of theresults for the overall comparison. When considering comparator subgroups (active control orplacebo), results for comparisons of liraglutide to placebo differed somewhat from those that hadbeen seen with comparisons of liraglutide to total comparator.The strati?ed analyses that Dr. Derr and Novo conducted were based on the 12 studies whichhad a placebo comparator group. Based on Novo?s analyses, 7 of the 12 point estimates for theincidence ratio of LGT versus placebo control were >1 .0. The upper 95% CI bound of all of the95% was >1.8 for all 12 estimates. Two of the 6 point estimates from time periodPopulation A exceeded 1.0; the Division considers time period Population A to be the primarytime period population of interest. Based on the FDA analysis, the upper 95% CI boundestimates were sensitive to the choice of estimation methodology, displaying a range from 1.25to 4.76, on both sides ofthe critical boundary of 1.8 (Tables 7.1.3.3.l.3.9, 7.l.3.3.l.3.l0,7.1 .3.3.1.3.l1 and 7.1 One estimate of the upper 95% CI bound was 3 werebetween 1.3 and 1.8, and 4 were >1 .8. Six of the 8 point estimates were The Agencybelieves that the sensitivity and the wide con?dence intervals are due in part to the low eventrates in the placebo arms (Tables 7.1 3.3.1 The number of actual events for the liraglutide and placebo control groups is summarized inTable 7.1.3.3.1.3.5. This summary illustrates that the event rates in placebo arms were low. Forexample, in analyses for the FDA Custom MACE endpoint, all TEAE, Pop A, there were only 3events in the combined placebo arms. In the analysis with the most placebo arm events (BroadSMQ, all TEAE, Pop B), there were only 13 events, of which only 3 were SAES.The reason why some point estimates were greater than 1 for subgroup analyses of liraglutideversus placebo is not clear. Because Dr. Derr and Novo conducted strati?ed analyses on the 12studies that had placebo groups, the clinical safety reviewer expects the distribution of baselinecardiovascular risk factors to be relatively similar among the randomized arms within each study.For this reason, the clinical safety reviewer does not expect an imbalance in baselinecardiovascular risk factors to contribute appreciably to an imbalance in the incidence of MACEevents between the liraglutide and placebo groups. As stated earlier, more placebo-treatedpatients were withdrawn from study for inadequate glycemic control and therefore, fewer ofthem may have been available to experience adverse cardiovascular events. The applicantconducted some analyses which took patient-year exposure into account, and these analyses hadsomewhat lower point estimated for liraglutide versus placebo (Tables 7.1.3.3.l.3.9-7.1.3.3.1.3.l2). Low event rates may have contributed to unstable point estimates.Liraglutide versus Active ControlThe strati?ed analyses that Dr. Derr and Novo conducted were based on the nine studies that hadan active control comparator. Based on Novo?s analyses, all 12 point estimates for the incidenceratio of LGT versus active control were <1 .0. All of the upper 95% CI bounds were <1 .8, withone being <1 .3.

Liraglutide is an analogue of the glucose-dependent insulinsecretagogue human glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is engineered to resist degradationby endogenous peptidases and thus contribute to long-term glycemic control with a decreased risk of hypoglycemia. The NDA was submitted on May 23, 2008. The proposed indication is asan adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetesmellitus. The target age group is adults aged 18 years and older.In pooled Phase clinical trials, nearly 10% of liraglutide recipients formed anti-drugantibodies (ADA), of which ~50% cross-reacted with native and ~10% demonstratedneutralizing activity in a cell-based assay. Although an ef?cacy analysis of the treatment effectof ADA formation, . cross?reactivity, and the presence of neutralizing ADA onglycosylated hemoglobin levels demonstrated no statistical impact of these factors on long-termglycemiccontrol, the assay used to detect liraglutide-speci?c ADA is directly inhibited by thedrug product itself. Although immunogenicity samples were drawn 25 days following last studydrug administration, sampling was not done uniformly for all subjects in the Phase 	7660	9890

Limitations of the development program arediscussed in section 6.1.4.5.There is a need for new antidiabetic drugs. There are now over 23 million patients diagnosed inthe U.S. alone and over 170 million worldwide with more than 1.5 million new cases per year.~Diabetes has a devastating impact on patients from diabetic microvascular complicationsincluding blindness, amputation, and the need for dialysis, as well as from cardiovasculardisease. A vast number of diabetic patients do not reach glycemic targets due to limitations ofcurrent therapies. Furthermore, since diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease, there is usuallythe need for additional treatments to be added to the patients? regimens over time. The results of the major clinical ef?cacy trials show that liraglutide has a clinically importanteffect on HbA1c compared to placebo and should be considered a useful addition to the diabeticdrug armamentarium. Comparison studies with liraglutide and other anti-diabetic drugs thatwere conducted as part of the liraglutide development program suggest that liraglutide is at leastas effective and in some cases, superior to, some other commonly used anti-diabetic drugs.1.3.3 SafetySee Dr. Mahoney?s safety review1.3.4 Dosing Regimen and AdministrationThe applicant?s proposed dosing regimen is as follows: For all patients liraglutide treatmentshould be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg for at least one week, after which the dose should beincreased to 1.2 mg. Based on tolerability and/or clinical response and after at least one week at1.2 mg, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg to achieve maximum ef?cacy. This reviewer agreeswith the Sponsor?s proposal on the basis of evidence of ef?cacy provided in the phase 3program. However, an alternative dosing regimen may be acceptable as described in the nextparagraph.The recommendation for approval for the Sponsor?s proposed dosing regimen is based on reviewof efficacy only. However, if the overall risk bene?t analysis shows a signi?cant safety concernfor the highest tested dose of liraglutide (1.8 mg daily), this reviewer concludes that the nexthighest tested dose of liraglutide (1.2 mg daily) has also shown substantial evidence ofeffectiveness from four phase 3 trials (four of the ?ve trials mentioned above tested the 1.2 mgdose) that, as stated above, are considered by this reviewer to be ?adequate and well-controlled?and would, in the situation of a safety concern for the 1.8 mg dose, recommend approval of amodi?ed dosing regimen with a maximal approved dose of liraglutide of 1.2 mg daily.	35994	38684

(liraglutide)2.3 Availability of Proposed Active Ingredient in the United StatesLiraglutide is not currently marketed in the UnitedeStates.2.4 - Important Issues with Pharmacologically Related ProductsLiraglutide is a member of the analogue class of antidiabetic therapies. Exenatide (marketed asByetta?) is the only FDA approved member of this class. Effectiveness concerns regarding Byetta havestemmed from immunogenicity patients who develop high titer antibodies to Byetta) with evidenceof reduced effectiveness in about half of patients with high titer antibodies. However, the developmentof high titer antibodies is relatively rare (Byetta prescribing information). With liraglutide, antibodygeneration has been 15% in completed trials over 26 weeks, with no apparent attenuation of glycemiccontrol in patients with high antibody titers. For a discussion of safety concerns that have arisen in thisclass see Dr. Mahoney?s safety review.2.5 Presubmission Regulatory ActivityThis section summarizes important presubmission activities including major milestone interactions withthe applicant and agreements made at each one focusing on clinical topics. 2.5.1 End-of?phase 2 meeting (face to face," 4 May 04)Proposed Phase 3 Study Design and Indication discussion:Discussion of DesignThe Division agreed that the proposed trials and trial designs are adequate to support the indication ofadjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, andthat the" comparator doses and the potential adjustment downwards are acceptable to support the abovementioned indication. The Division considered the statistical plan acceptable.EndpointsPrimary endpoints were agreed upon and were adhered to by the sponsor. The sponsor asked if theAgency agreed that the described approach of assessing the improvement in beta cell function supportsthe indication. The Division stated that response to this question is deferred until review of the NDAsubmission. The sponsor was informed that considerationwould be given based on submitted data,strength of the evidence, and the appropriateness of the endpoints as surrogates for delayed progressionof type 2 diabetes.

The sponsorcomplied with the recommendations/plans in this NDA submission. SafetyDiscussion also focused on the strategy of safety evaluation for liraglutide. The sponsor generallycomplied with all FDA requests and, per Dr. Mahoney, any information requested by the safety reviewerwas provided in a timely fashion. -Risk management planThe topic of a risk management plan was raised. No formal agreements were reached at this pre-NDAmeeting. It was deemed too early to determine whether the proposed program was acceptable. TheSponsor was encouraged to engage in further discussions with FDA about the nature of the risks and thepotential need for a Risk Minimization Action Plan if they believed that there were productrisks that merit more than conventional professional product labeling package insert (P1) or patientpackage insert and postmarketin surveillance to manage risks.DeviceThe Sponsor was encouraged to submit the proposed device (a working model of the same pre?f1lled penwhich was used in the clinical trials) and all associated packaging, any usability studies performed onthe pre-filled pen, the proprietary name and all associated labels and labeling for review as soon asavailable.Pediatric studies -The status of pediatric investigation was discussed. At the End of Phase 2 Meeting, May 4, 2004, the Division agreed to the sponsor?s plan to seek a waiver for subjects below -ryears and a deferral forolder children. The sponsor reported plans to conduct a trial inpediatric patients with type 2 diabetes including children of age 10 years and older. The Agency did notimmediately agree with this plan but rather asked the sponsor to submit the proposal and all referencesto support the proposal and it would be reviewed. The sponsor outlined the proposed pediatric trial and were informed that the study design as proposed, wouldnot satisfy the requirement for pediatric assessment under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA)because it would not adequately address the ef?cacy and safety of liraglutide in pediatric subjects, norwould this proposal be sufficient to obtain pediatric exclusivity under the Best Pharmaceuticalsfor Children Act (BPCA).2.6 Other Relevant Background InformationRegulatory actions in other countriesLiraglutide was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on 30 Jun 09.16	52306	54818

These include the extension phases of two ofthe phase 3 trials since data as of a cutoff date of 21 Feb 2008 were submitted to support long termsafety of liraglutide. However, these trials were still ongoing at the time of NDA submission and are notused to support efficacy claims. In sum, there are a total of 40 trials listed in the tables. Of the 40 trials,two trials investigated liraglutide delivered by alternative routes of administration; NN2211-1464(pulmonary administration) and NN9233-1898 (intranasal administration).The clinical pharmacology development program was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamic properties of liraglutide and included 26 clinical pharmacology trials.

At this site, subjects were screened, subjects were enrolled, and subjects completed the study. There were rr subjects on placebodiscontinued due to lack of efficacy. An audit of 10 subjects? records was conducted. No regulatoryviolations were noted. No under-reporting of adverse events was detected. The DSI inspector concludedthat the study appears to have been conducted adequately, and the data generated by this site appearacceptable in support of the respective indication. 4.5 Compliance with Good Clinical PracticesThe clinical studies were conducted in accordance with ethical standards including informed consentfrom all subjects.All attempts were made to adhere to protocol guidelines. Furthermore, an individual subject?scompliance to the protocol was scrutinized prior to database release and subjects with violations to theprotocol that were considered to affect the efficacy assessments were excluded from the ?per protocol?analysis sets (see section 6). Analyses using per protocol sets were used to support the primary intentionto treat analyses. Reasons for being excluded from the per protocol analysis set included not having anevaluable HbA1c at the ?nal study visit, not meeting all inclusion criteria, or meeting exclusion criteria,not meeting randomization criteria, or subjects with HbA1c values taken at baseline more than threedays apart from the date of the first dose of study medication, among others. For the primary efficacyendpoint in all 5 pivotal phase 3 studies, the per protocol analyses supported the primary intention totreat analyses. Speci?c protocol violations and study design procedural deviations are discussed withinthe context of each trial design (section 6).4.6 Financial DisclosuresMost, but not all investigators who enrolled subjects in phase 2/3 studies submitted ?nancial disclosureforms.

According to Dr.Khurana these de?ciencies have been resolved at the time of this review and a memo documenting theresolution is forthcoming. Key ?ndings from Dr. Khurana?s review are summarized in sections 5.1, 5.2and 5.3 below.5.1 PharmacokineticsLiraglutide was studied in healthy subjects and T2DM patients to determine pharrnacokinetic properties.27	74350	77182

(liraglutide)AssThe effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was investigated in the single dose trial, Trial1327 and based on the population pharmacokinetics from Trial 1573. Liraglutide was declaredequivalent in young and elderly subjects after a single 1 mg dose. There was no effect of age on otherpharmacokinetic endpoints.Race/EthnicityThe impact of race and ethnicity on pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was investigated using thepopulation pharmacokinetic data from Trial 1573. Five racial groups (White, Asian, Black, Hawaiian,and ?Other?) and two ethnic categories (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) were investigated. In an analysis ofcovariance including body weight and gender, race and ethnicity were not significantly associated withpharmacokinetic variables.Renal and Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of a single s.c. dose of 0.75 mg liraglutide administered in the abdomen insubjects with renal impairment was evaluated in Trial 1329. Subjects with four different grades of renalimpairment (based on creatinine clearance estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) were comparedagainst subjects with normal renal function. Overall on average, the of liraglutide was around19 - 35% 1 in the renally impaired subjects than the normal subjects. However, equivalence wasdemonstrated for maximum concentration (Crnax) a subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine .?clearance greater than 30 but less than or equal to 50 mL/minute). Total apparent clearance variedacross the renal groups; however, no trend with respect to renal function was seen.The pharmacokinetics of a single s.c. dose of 0.75 mg liraglutide injected in the thigh was evaluated insubjects with hepatic impairment in Trial 1328. Subjects with three different grades of hepaticimpairment (classi?ed according to the Child-Pugh scores) were compared against subjects with normalhepatic function. Severe hepatic impairment was found to have an impact on the liraglutidepharmacokinetics in terms of around a two?fold increase in clearance and 42% lower mean ofliraglutide. The reason for this ?nding is unknown, but could possibly be attributed to lower albuminlevels found in hepatic impairment, as a statistically significant positive relationship between albuminconcentration and liraglutide exposure was observed.No dose adjustment is proposed by either the sponsor or by Dr. Khurana, the clinical pharmacologyreviewer, for renal and hepatic impairment subjects.Pharmacokinetic effects of drug-drug interactionsPlease see Dr. Mahoney?s review for a discussion of drug-drug interactions.30	82600	85256

Please also refer to section 4.2 Tables ofClinical Studies for details of the ef?cacy trials including study designs, dosages, and treatmentdurations. A total of 3978 patients were exposed to treatment in the therapeutic con?rmatory trials (2501to liraglutide, 524 to placebo, and 953 to an active comparator). In addition to the therapeuticcon?rmatory trials, six therapeutic exploratory trials (Trials 1571, 1310, 1333, 2072, 1499 and 1334(Japan)) provide some additional relevant ef?cacy data. These trials enrolled a total of 966 patients.Open-label extension studies (1572 extended to 18 months to a total of 2 years and 1573 extended to48 months for a total of 5 years) are not usedto support ef?cacy claims and therefore, not reviewed inthis section, but are used to support long-term safety and are discussed by Dr. Mahoney in her ClinicalSafety Review.Table 6.1Overview of Ef?cacy Data for LiraglutideSource of dataDetailsPhase 2 dose or regimenselection6 studies2 placebo-controlled dose ?nding trials (dose selection) (1571, 1310)Liraglutide vs. placebo for body weight reduction (1333)Active control (metformin) dose ?nding trial (2072)Individual dose titration W/add on to metformin (1499) 9Placebo-controlled dose ?nding Japanese trial (1334)Phase 3 con?rmatory trials5 studies1 monotherapy phase 3 trial (1573)2 add-on combination therapy with one OAD studies (1572, 1436)2 add-on combination therapy with two OADS studies (1574, 1697)33	89505	91872

Six phase 2 studies relevant for ef?cacy arediscussed in section 10. The ?ve therapeutic con?rmatory trials were similar in design. All trials wererandomized, parallel group, multi-center trials in which the therapeutic response to liraglutide wascompared with that of placebo and/or a speci?c active comparator drug.The designs of the ?ve major studies supporting effectiveness for the proposed indication are adequateand well controlled in that: (1) There is a clear statement of the objectives of the investigation and a summary of the proposed oractual methods of analysis in the protocols for thestudy and in the report of their results. In addition, theprotocols contain a description of the proposed methods of analysis, and the study reports contain adescription of the methods of analysis ultimately used.(2) The studies use designs that permit a valid comparison with a control to provide a quantitativeassessment of drug effect. The protocols for the study and report of results describe the study designsprecisely.(3) The method of selection of subjects provides adequate assurance that they have the disease orcondition being studied.(4) The method of assigning patients to treatment and control groups minimizes bias and is intended toassure comparability of the groups with respect to pertinent variables. In the case of the ?ve pivotalstudies, assignment is by randomization, with strati?cation.(5) Adequate measures are taken to minimize bias on the part of the subjects, observers, and ofthe data since the majority of the studies are double-blind.(6) The methods of assessment of subjects? response are well-de?ned and reliable. HbA1c is anobjective, surrogate measure of glycemic control (see section 6.1.2).(7) There is an analysis of the results of the study adequate to assess the effects of the drug (see sectionand also Dr. Derr?s Statistical Review). 40	105440	108157

Improved glycemic control resulting from this regimen 3change would not be fully re?ected in the baseline HbA1c measurement (HbA1c representsglycemic control over the prior three months). This could lead to over-estimation of the withingroup primary efficacy variable (change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint) in these patientsbecause some of the improvement in HbAlc during the double-blind treatment period would beattributable to the recent increase in metformin dosage. Therefore, the change in HbA1c should bereported relative to placebo.Study Design Procedural Deviations . The NGSP Level I certi?cation for testing of HbA1c at expired 1 September 2006.

Reviewer?s comment: This reviewer agrees that this protocol deviation is not likely to haveaffected study results because the number of affected samples from visit 3, (the visit at which thebaseline HbA1c measurement was obtained) was only 21, and the number of affected samplesfrom visit 10, the study endpoint visit (the visit at which the ?nal HbA1c measurement for analysisof the primary ef?cacy endpoint was obtained) was only 6. This small number of affected samplesis unlikely to have resulted in altered -study results.18 month extension period of trial 1572This report aimed to ful?ll the FDA request to present data following longer exposure time for a largenumber of subjects. At Visit 10 at 26 weeks after randomization, all subjects were asked to confirm theircontinued participation in an 18-month, voluntary, open-label treatment extension period. Subjects whocontinued into the extension period were unblinded to treatment assignment at their first visit at the siteafter database release and continued the treatment regimen they had been randomized to in the blindedpart of the trial. Data from the extension trial are used to support safety (see Dr. Mahoney?s ClinicalSafety Review).6.1.3.82 (Liraglutide glimepiride) vs. (placebo glimepiride) vs. (rosiglitazone glimepiride)Trial 1436: Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD-1): Effect on glycemic control after oncedaily administration of liraglutide in combination with glimepiride versus glimepiride monotherapyversus glimepiride and rosiglitazone combination therapy in subjects with type 2 diabetesThe rationale for this trial was to demonstrate that the addition of liraglutide to existing sulfonylurea(SU) therapy, glimepiride, provides additional improvements in glycemic control. Furthermore, therationale was to compare liraglutide in combination with glimepiride to glimepiride monotherapy and torosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), in combination with glimepiride.This was a 6 month, multicenter (116 centers in 21 countries), randomized, double?blind, double-dummy, active control, ?ve armed parallel group study. 1041 subjects were randomized in a 2:2:2:l:2ratio to:Liraglutide active (0.6 mg/day) glimepiride (2-4 mg/day) rosiglitazone placeboLiraglutide active (1.2 mg/day) glimepiride (2-4 mg/day) rosiglitazone placeboLiraglutide active (1.8 mg/day) glimepiride (2-4 mg/day) rosiglitazone placeboLiraglutide placebo glimepiride (2-4 mg/day) rosiglitazone placeboLiraglutide placebo glimepiride (2-4 mg/day) rosiglitazone (4mg/day)Procedures (Figure 6.4):49	128100	131019

An assessment of the inter-laboratory differences in HbA1c levels of samples that were assayed byboth laboratories.The responses submitted on 29 Jul 2009 were as follows:1. We looked into the 52 subjects randomized in trial 1697 described above. These were all randomizedin . .. In comparison to the original ITT population we excluded 51 subjects (1 subject did nothave any samples reanalyzed in and 50 subjects had at least one post?baseline sample  reanalyzed in The remaining subject (820005) did not have any post baseline values and wastherefore not included in the original analysis (and was also not included in the revised analysis).We analyzed the primary endpoint change in HbA1c at the end of 26 weeks using the same model asdescribed originally excluding the 51 subjects. To facilitate comparison to the original results weperformed the same three analyses ITT with LOCF, ITT without imputation, and the PP population.  The ANCOVA results for the ITT with LOCF population showed that lirag1utide+OADs loweredby -1.29% (vs. -1.33% in the original analysis), glargine+OADs by -1.10% (vs. -1.09% in theoriginal analysis), and placebo+OADs by -0.25% (vs. -0.24% in the original analysis). The tests ofsuperiority were similar to the original analysis, i.e. liraglutide+OADs was superior to both theglargine+OADs group and the placebo+OADs group.2. We looked into the inter-laboratory differences by plotting the average vs. the difference (so calledBland?Altrnan plot), and also performed a statistical analysis. We found a difference between the meanof HbA1c values from the two analysis of -0.56 p<0.000l) with results at  being lower than at  Reviewer?s comment: Although there appears to be lower mean HbA1c values at compared to the mean changes from baseline were not sensitive to excluding the subjects  4;whose samples had to be reanalyzed due to the protocol deviation. Therefore, the overall efficacyconclusions are not affected by the protocol deviation.6.1.3.9 Study design conclusions:Based on review of the study designs, this reviewer concludes that the designs are adequate to provideassessment of bene?t in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, are of adequate duration to allow for suchconclusions, allow for generalizability of results (excepting severely ill diabetics with high HbA1c levelsas well as advanced cardiovascular disease and other excluded populations, i.e. renal and hepaticfailure), and that the doses studied in the pivotal Phase 3 trials were adequate based on the ?ndings inPhase 2.55	144076	146897

(liraglutide)Reviewer?s comment: While the weight change in the liraglutide groups was statisticallysigni?cantly different from the comparator (mostly because the comparator induced weight gain),the absolute percentage weight loss in the liraglutide groups is less than that seen with alreadyFDA approved drugs for obesity. The summary of distribution of body weight change percentageshowed that about a quarter of subjects actually gained weight while on liraglutide therapy andabout half lost less than 5% of body weight.Further analyses were performed to determine if nausea contributed to the greater weight loss seen in theliraglutide groups. Subjects were categorized based upon the number of days nausea was reported in theearly phase of the trial (up to 8 weeks of treatment) and in the late phase (after 8 weeks of treatment).The Sponsor reports that greater weight loss was observed in the subjects who experiencednausea, but all liraglutide-treated groups demonstrated a mean weight loss.6.1.4.1.7.6 Measures of beta-cell function and insulin resistanceFive endpoints were related to [3-cell function and insulin secretion (fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide,pro-insulin to insulin ratio, HOMA index of B-cell function, and HOMA index of insulin resistance).Fasting insulin values from baseline? to end of treatment showed a decrease in the liraglutide groupcompared with the glimepiride group (adjusted mean difference -22.7 pmol/L, There were nodifferences in C-peptide values among treatment groups (all were decreased). The pro-insulin to insulinratio (calculated from fasting insulin and fasting pro-insulin) decreased in both liraglutide treatmentgroups, and increased in the glimepiride group. However, ANCOVA analysis of the estimatedmean changes in the ratios demonstrated that the differences between the liraglutide groups and theglimepiride group were not statistically significant.B-cell function was assessed by HOMA. ANCOVA analysis demonstrated no difference between thetreatment groups. Insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR was reduced in the liraglutide treatmentgroups compared with the glimepiride group in an ANCOVA model using the LOCF population(lira 1.8 vs. glimepiride adjusted mean difference 95% CI -3.5 p=0.001 1, lira 1.2 vs.glimepiride adjusted mean difference 95% CI -2.8 p=0.0249, lira 1.8 vs. lira 1.2 adjustedmeandifference not significant). Similar results were observed in an analysis performed with Week 52values, although the differences were not signi?cant.Reviewer?s comment: Using the completer?ITT no imputation) analysis set the results werenot statistically signi?cant calling into question the robustness of these efficacy results. Measuresof beta-cell function and insulin resistance, including HOMA, have not yet risen to the level ofinclusion in labeling primarily because they are not fully validated surrogates.Blood Pressure7]	174701	177664

The decreases occurred after 2-4 weeks of treatment and were maintained to theend of the treatment period. ANCOVA, including baseline value as a covariate, of change in SBP withthe LOCF-ITT analysis set showed that liraglutide lowered SBP signi?cantly more than glimepiride.The liraglutide 1.8 mg group had an adjusted mean reduction in SBP of 3.64 (from a meanbaseline of 128 mmHg), the liraglutide 1.2 mg group a mean reduction of 2.12 (baseline: 128mmHg) and the glimepiride group a mean reduction of 0.69 (baseline: 130 mmHg). Thedifference between the reduction in SBP from liraglutide 1.8 mg and glimepiride was statisticallysigni?cant (2.95 mmHg, 0.0117). Using the completer-ITT no imputation) analysis set theresults were not statistically signi?cant (mean adjusted difference between liraglutide 1.8 andglimepiride -2.72, 95% CI -5.5 0.03, For diastolic BP there were no differences betweentreatment groups.The proportions of subjects reaching targets of a diastolic blood pressure below 80 and a SBPbelow 130 was compared between the liraglutide groups and the glimepiride group using a chi-square test. Using LOCF, 42.1% of subjects in the liraglutide 1.8 mg group, 41.2% of subjects in theliraglutide 1.2 mg group, and 34.7% of subjects in the glimepiride group reached this target. Thesedifferences were not statistically signi?cant and the results were similar when performing the analysison Week 52 values. 1Reviewer?s comment: Using the completer-ITT no imputation) analysis set the results werenot statistically significant calling into question the robustness of these blood pressure efficacyresults. However, in this case there appears to be a trend comparing liraglutide 1.8 mg toglimepiride On the other hand, using a dichotomous variable (subjects reaching targetsof "diastolic BP below 80 and a systolic BP below 130 mmHg) and chi-square test, therewere still no differences among treatment groups.The data listings of concomitant medication that may have an effect on blood pressure,medications known as anti-diuretics, and medications for edema were not presented.

With liraglutide 0.6 mgmetformin signi?cantly fewer subjects reached the target compared with the glimepiride metformingroup. The same pattern was observed with respect to the percentage of subjects reaching the AACEtarget. For Trial 143 6, the percentage of subjects achieving the ADA target with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8mg glimepiride) was signi?cantly higher than with rosiglitazone glimepiride. With liraglutide at the0.6 mg dose there was no difference. The same pattern was observed with respect to the percentage ofsubjects reaching the AACE target.Reviewer?s comment: These results appear similar to the primary ef?cacy variable in thatliraglutide OAD was better than placebo OAD for both trials, but with the active comparators,liraglutide added to metformin was not better than glimepiride added to metformin, and at the 0.6mg dose was actually Worse than metformin glimepiride, while liraglutide at both the 1.2and 1.8 mg doses added to glimepiride was better than rosiglitazone added to glimepiride. Thesame caveat that was mentioned in section 6.l.4.2.3.2 applies regarding the comparison with halfmaximal rosiglitazone dose.Although no statistical comparison of liraglutide 1.2 mg vs. liraglutide 1.8 mg was reported, thepercentage of subjects reaching the ADA target in both trials was higher in the liraglutide 1.8 mggroup compared with the 1.2 mg group lending support to the conclusion of greater efficacy forthe 1.8 mg dose over the 1.2 mg dose when added on to one OAD. For the AACE target thisdistinction was less clear since in trial 1436 the percentages reaching target for the 1.8 mg groupand the 1.2 mg group were similar.Table 6.24Percentage of Subjects Reaching ADA Target (HbA1c at 26 weeks ("add-on therapy with oneOAD trials)Logistic RegressionPlacebo ComparatorofSubjectsReaching Odds Odds Target (SEM) Ratio 95% CI value Ratio 95% CI valueTrial 1572Metformin add-on Lira 0.6 67 28.03 0.144 4.13 2.05 8.30 <.000l 0.63 0.41 0.97 0.0357Lira 1.2 82 35.34 0.137 5.86 2.92 <.000l 0.89 0.58 1.36 0.594711.72Lira 1.8 100 42.37 0.132 8.97 4.48 <.000l 1.36 0.90 2.07 0.146717.94Placebo 13 10.83 0.294Comparator 85 36.32 0.136Trial 1436Glimepiride82	199701	202128

The two highest doses ofliraglutide appear virtually identical in their FPG lowering effect. Liraglutide at all doses wassimilar to glimepiride when added to metforinin. Liraglutide at the two highest doses was betterthan rosiglitazone when added to glimepiride. The previously discussed caveat applies regardingthe half maximal rosiglitazone comparator dose.Plots of FPG values by treatment and week are shown for trial 1572 in Figure 6.12 and for trial 1436 inFigure 6.13. In summary, for trials 1572 and 1436, in the 3 liraglutide groups and in the activecomparator treatment groups, FPG decreased within the ?rst 2 weeks after randomization while anincrease in FPG was seen in the placebo treatment groups. During the remaining 24 weeks of the trial,no change to a slight increase in FPG was demonstrated for all 3 liraglutide treatment groups and theactive comparator treatment groups, although the end of treatment FPG values for these treatmentgroups were still below the baseline values.87	211078	212878

It may first appear to be due to the higherbaseline weights in trial 1572. However, there was a higher proportion of men in trial 1572, andthe baseline BMIs were similar between the two trials.Figure 6.14 shows that for trial 1572, during the period from treatment start to Weeks 8-12, the 3liraglutide+metformin groups and the placebo+metformin group appeared to show reductions in meanbody weight, whereas the glimepiride+metformin group showed an increase in mean body weight.Figure 6.15 shows that for trial 1436 during the period from treatment start to Week 8, the two highestdose liraglutide+glimepiride groups and the glimepiride group appeared to show reductions in meanbody weight, whereas the rosiglitazone+ glimepiride treatment group showed an increase in mean bodyweight. From Week 8 until end of treatment, the mean body weight appeared to increase in thethree liraglutide treatment groups and the glimepiride treatment group.

(liraglutide)In the two trials some measures of beta?cell function signi?cantly improved in the liraglutide groupsrelative to the comparators and placebo groups as follows:In trial 1572 increases (by 20-26 percentage points) in HOMA-B from baseline to end of treatment wereseen in the 3 liraglutide groups and in the glimepiride+metformin group, while no relevant change wasseen in the metformin group. There were slight decreases in the pro-insulin to insulin ratio in the 3liraglutide groups and in the glimepiride+metformin group, while no relevant change was seen in themetformin group. There were no significant differences between the 3 liraglutide groups and theg1imepiride+metformin group with respect to change in HOMA-B or pro-insulin to insulin ratio. Therewas no difference in fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide or HOMA-IR between the liraglutide groups andthe comparator or placebo group.In trial 1436, measures of beta-cell function including fasting insulin, C-peptide, pro-insulin to insulinratio, and HOMA-B showed signi?cant improvement favoring liraglutide in some analyses althoughthese changes were not always dose dependent. For HOMA-IR, no statistically signi?cant differenceswere seen between liraglutide at any dose, in addition to glimepiride, and glimepiride alone or .rosiglitazone+glimepiride treatments. Comparable results were obtained when the same analysis wasperformed without data imputation, except for a signi?cantly reduced insulin resistance observed in therosiglitazone+glimepiride treatment group versus the liraglutide 1.8 mg+glimepiride treatment group.Reviewer?s comment: The proposed label reports that liraglutide. . Ibut these data suggest this effect may not be consistent across trials as these two 26-week trials showed different results regarding HOMA-IR. However, it may not be appropriate tocompare monotherapy to add-on therapy.6.l.4.2.6.5 Blood PressureThe results of analyses of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for trials 1572 and 1436 are summarized inTable 6.29. Reductions in SBP from baseline to week 26 were seen in all treatment groups except theactive comparator group in trial 1572 which had a small mean increase.In an ANCOVA model, there were no signi?cant differences between the 3 liraglutide groups and theplacebo groups with respect to change in SBP in either trial. When compared to the active comparatorarms, there were no differences between the 3 liraglutide groups and the rosiglitazone+glimepiridegroup in trial 1436, but in trial 1574 the change in SBP was signi?cantly different between theliraglutide 1.2 mg+metformin and liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin groups which showed lowering frombaseline and the glimepiride+metformin group which experienced a small increase from baseline. Whensensitivity analyses were performed on the data set with no imputation, the same conclusions werereached except for the difference between the liraglutide 1.8 mg+metformin group and theglimepiride+metformin group in trial 1574, which was not statistically signi?cant (data not shown).There were no significant ?ndings related to diastolic blood pressure for either trial.95	223327	226530

The Sponsor should increase enrollment of minorities in ongoing liraglutide studies toobtain a better assessment of efficacy in these populations.Given the similar efficacy between liraglutide 1remains to be seen whether thesmall bene?t of 1.8 mg over 1.2 mg is worth any extra risk incurred by the higher dose. This decisionwill be made taking the safety review into account.Rosiglitazone 8 mg qd is the maximal FDA approved dose. In trial 1436, the highest proposed doses ofliraglutide are being compared to the half maximal dose of rosiglitazone (4 mg qd). Therefore, caution iswarranted in concluding that liraglutide is superior to rosiglitazone given at the maximal FDA approveddose of 8 mg.In trial 1697, the rate of attainment of fasting plasma glucose goals for the glargine comparator groupwas notably low. Therefore, caution is also warranted in making conclusions regarding the ef?cacy ofliraglutide added to two OADS to the efficacy of glargine added to those same OADs.6.1.5 Clinical MicrobiologyNot applicable to this NDA6.1.6 Efficacy ConclusionsSee section 6.1.4.67 INTEGRATED REVIEW OF SAFETYThe entirety of section 7 was completed by Dr. Mahoney in her Clinical Safety Review.8 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL ISSUES8.1 Dosing Regimen and AdministrationThe sponsor?s proposed dosing regimen is as follows: 1 For all patients liraglutide treatment should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg for at least one week, afterwhich the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. Based on tolerability and/or clinical response and after atleast one week at 1.2 mg, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg to achieve maximum efficacy. The dosecan be given any time of day and does not need to be given in relation to meals.121	273697	275503

The minimally effective dose was notestablished by this phase 2 study. The maximally effective dose seems to be close to 1.90 mg.Trial 1310Primary Objectives: to establish the dose-response relationship on glycemic control of ?ve dose levelsof liraglutide and placebo. Design: A 12-week, multi-center, multi-national, seven-arm parallel-grouptrial with ?ve doses of liraglutide (0.045, 0.225, 0.45, 0.60 or 0.75 mg/day, double-blind) versusplacebo double-blind) or glimepiride (1 or 2 mg, open-label) in subjects with type 2 diabetesmellitus. E?icacy Results: The effect of liraglutide on HbAlc increased with increasing dose; theestimated maximal effect, Emax, was a 1.74 percent unit decrease, while the estimated dose for half-maximal effect, ED50, was 0.76 mg. As the estimated ED50 was similar to the highest doseinvestigated, this indicates that only the lower part of the dose-response curve has been established inthis trial. A dose-response relationship was found for glycemic control. After 12 weeks of treatment,HbAlchad decreased in all but the lowest liraglutide dose group. Mean HbAlc decreasedby -0.70 at 0.60 mg and -0.75 at 0.75 mg and the difference was signi?cant ascompared to placebo (p=0.0002 and p<0.000l, respectively).RevieWer?s comment: This trial establishes that the ED50 is 0.76 mg. Therefore, the selection of0.6 mg as the starting dose in the phase 3 program "is appropriate. 126	284040	286824

It is metabolized by dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, and by other peptidases..Liraglutide slows gastric emptying, and thus may prolong Tmax, and lower Cmax of orallyadministered drugs. Liraglutide delayed Tmax and lowered Cmax for atorvastatin, lisinopril,paracetamol and digoxin. For griseo?ilvin, however, Cmax was 37% higher at liraglutide steadystate conditions when compared to placebo. The clinical signi?cance of these effects is underdiscussion with the Clinical Pharmacology team.No drug-drug interaction study with warfarin was performed. There have been postmarketingreports of possible warfarin interactions with exenatide. The Clinical Pharmacology team isdiscussing whether a warfarin interaction study would be advisable for liraglutide.1.3.6 Special PopulationsDosage adjustment does not appear necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.There were too few patients age 75 years or older to make conclusions regarding dosing in thispopulation; the 1.8 mg dose may be associated with more gastrointestinal and nervous systemadverse events in this age group than in younger patients. No dosage adjustment appearsnecessary by race or ethnicity.Page 11 of249	322214	323988

A full listing of adverseevents had not been provided in the original NDA, but the applicant complied with a request tosubmit a complete list. An inquiry from the Agency regarding missing calcitonin data led theapplicant to submit corrected calcitonin analyses on 25 Jun 2009 and 8 Jul 2009; the applicantreported that there had been a programming error in the calcitonin analyses. Two inquiries fromthe Agency regarding bilirubin data led the applicant to submit corrected analyses on 17 Jul2009; the applicant reported that there ?had been a programming error in the bilirubin analyses.An inquiry from the Agency regarding serum creatinine values raised a question regardingwhether the applicant had appropriately captured elevated values. The Agency is awaitingclari?cation of this discrepancy from the applicant.The Division of Scienti?c Investigations performed multiple inspections of Novo facilities andinvestigative sites related to this application. Inspections were performed of clinical and analytic -facilities in Plainsboro, New Jersey; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Lund, Sweden. The PlainsboroNew Jersey site inspection revealed some minor procedural de?ciencies; the applicant submitteda corrective plan which the inspector concluded was adequate. The applicant also submittedresponses to de?ciencies noted at the Copenhagen and Lund sites; as of 21 Jul 2009, evaluationof the adequacy of the applicant?s responses by the Division of Scienti?c Investigations ispending. In addition, individual study sites were inspected in Des Moines, Iowa; Las Lomas,Puerto Rico; and Los Angeles, Califomia. Inspection of the site in Puerto Rico revealed someminor regulatory violations which the investigator at the site agreed to correct. At all sites, theconclusion was that the data generated from the sites could be used in support of the application.34.5 Compliance with Good Clinical PracticesPlease see Dr. Yanoff? clinical ef?cacy review.4.6 Financial DisclosuresPlease see Dr. Yanoff? clinical ef?cacy review.5 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYPlease see Dr. Khurana?s Clinical Pharmacology review and Dr. Yanoff? clinical ef?cacyreview. Drug?drug interactions are discussed in Section 8.2. Dr. Khurana found the clinicalpharmacology evaluation acceptable, and does not have recommendations for postmarketingcommitments related to clinical pharmacology issues.No dose adjustment is proposed for renal or hepatic impairment. In a renal study, AUC 0-infwas 19-35% lower in renally impaired patients than in patients with normal renal function.Page 22 of249	345147	348072

(liraglutide injection) 7Severe hepatic impairment was associated with a Zefold increase in clearance and a 42% meanlower AUC 0?inf for liraglutide.Liraglutide?s effect on metabolism by multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms was investigated, andliraglutide had little effect. It is metabolized by DPP4, and by other peptidases.Liraglutide slows gastric emptying, and thus may prolong Tmax, and lower Cmax of orallyadministered drugs. Liraglutide delayed Tmax and lowered Cmax for atorvastatin, lisinopril,paracetamol and digoxin. For griseo?ilvin, however, Cmax was 37% higher at liraglutide steadystate conditions when compared to placebo. The clinical significance of this effect is underdiscussion with the Clinical Pharmacology team. Liraglutide lowered the Cmax ofethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 12 and 13%, respectively, and delayed Tmax by 1.5 hrs;these effects are unlikely to affect the contraceptive efficacy of these drugs.6 INTEGRATED REVIEW OF EFFICACYPlease see Dr. Yanoffs clinical ef?cacy review.7 INTEGRATED REVIEW OF SAFETY7.1 Methods and Findings7.1.1 DeathsAt the time of submission of the NDA, the applicant reported a total of 8 deaths in the liraglutidedevelopment program. Three deaths occurred among liraglutide-treated patients, three occurredamong active-comparator-treated patients, and two occurred in patients who had not yet beenrandomized to a study drug. The applicant states that they have reported all deaths of which theyhave knowledge, even those which occurred after study drug discontinuation.

This was a 71 year old Spanish woman who presentedwith blurred vision and ?vision of black dots? after 297 days of LGT 1.8 mg/day. She had aprior history of glaucoma and hypertension. She was admitted. Ophthalmoscopy showed paleoptic papillae and atrophic retinal lesions. Intraocular pressure was 45 mmHg. ?Hypertensiveuveitis? was diagnosed. She was treated with dexamethasone, atropine, and cusimolol. Angiography was not performed. Serology (not specified) showed ?nothing abnormal?. Shewas discharged one day later, and one month later was considered recovered.Patient 180014 had an event of Crohn?s disease. This was a 52 year old American woman whopresented with ?regional enteritis? after 462 days of liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. The narrative statesonly that the patient was admitted to the hospital and discharged two days later. No details ofhow the diagnosis of Crohn?s disease was made, or what treatment was administered, wereprovided.Patient 188004 had an event of acute adrenocortical insuf?ciency. This was a 47 year oldAmerican woman with a prior history of adrenogenital hirsutism, ovaries,vitamin de?ciency, dyslipidemia and depression. She presented with ?adrenal crisis? after 226days of liraglutide 1.2 mg/day. At presentation, her potassium was 6.6 mEq/L. The narrativestates that the patient was discontinued from study at this time, but discontinuation was due toalcohol abuse. The narrative does not speci?cally state that the patient was admitted to thehospital at that time. It does state that she was admitted seven days later due to hyperkalemia,with a serum potassium of 7.0 mEq/L. She also had bronchitis. Aldactone was discontinued,and she received intravenous ?uids and Kayexalate. Intravenous hydrocortisone and anintravenous insulin drip were administered. was also administered. She wasdischarged three days later. She did not resume study, and began subcutaneous insulin fortreatment of her diabetes.

After three days in hospital, the patient was discharged. After about onemore month, the pain resolved.Patient 762012 had an event of collagen disorder. This was a 59 year old Polish man whopresented with fever, weakness, abdominal pain and after 123 days of liraglutide1.8 mg/day. He was diagnosed with ?collagenosis? and ?sperrnatitis?. He was treated withNovomix? (mixed insulin aspart and insulin aspart) and cipro?oxacin.Study medication was discontinued. He was discharged after 17 days in the hospital. Thenarrative does not include details of how the diagnosis of collagen disorder was assigned.?Collagenosis? is an alternative term for collagen-vascular disease, and is defined as ?any of agroup of diseases affecting connective tissue and often characterized by tibrinoid necrosis orvasculitis and including such diseases as lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis,rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, polyarteritis nodosa and dermatomyositis?.Although there was an apparent imbalance in serious immune system events based on eventterms, review of narratives revealed that several of the events were exacerbations of pre-existingconditions, and others had inadequate information to assign causality. Patients 188004 and504010 had pre-existing chronic adrenal insuf?ciency, and presented with acute adrenalinsufficiency at the time of infections, a common scenario in patients with chronic adrenalinsuf?ciency. Patient 516007 presented with an exacerbation of pre-existing rheumatoidarthritis. Patient 175012?s uveitis, Patient 52601l?s myositis, and Patient 471040?s COP werenot clearly immune in etiology. Patient 375005?s angioedema appeared temporally related toantibiotic therapy rather than LGT therapy. There were too few details of Patient 1800l4?sCrohn?s disease and Patient 7620l2?s collagen disorder to assign causality. Overall, it appearsunlikely that LGT was associated with causality for new immune disorders. If another largestudy of LGT is initiated, e.g. for cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, systematic collection ofimmune system event datawould be useful.7.1.3 Dropouts and Other Signi?cant Adverse Events7.1.3.1 Overall pro?le of dropoutsAcross the development program, the highest rate of withdrawal occurred among placebo-treatedpatients, for whom the most common reason for withdrawal was ineffectiveness of therapy.Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common among LGT-treated patients than amongcomparator-treated patients, with gastrointestinal events contributing to the excess withdrawalrate. This excess withdrawal rate was seen primarily for the 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day dose groups; themost common reason for withdrawal from the 0.6 mg/day dose group was ineffectiveness oftherapy.The following table summarizes disposition for the five major Phase 3 trials.Page 35 of249	376758	379710

This difference was largely accounted for by more withdrawals forgastrointestinal (GI) events among liraglutide-treated patients, especially events of nausea,vomiting and diarrhea.All withdrawals due to injection site events (8 versus 0), and all withdrawals due to hepatobiliarydisorders (5 versus 0), occurred among liraglutide?treated patients.The event of ?hepatic enzyme increased? in a liraglutide-treated patient occurred in a 42 year oldman (ID 267005) who had a maximum elevation of alanine aminotransferase of 85 (ULN 43but who was withdrawn from study due to the event.The event of ?aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased? occurred in a 57 year old man (ID499003), who had a baseline elevation of AST to 129 (ULN 43 After 3 months ofliraglutide treatment, he had an AST of 174 and LGT was discontinued. After 42 days offliraglutide, he was considered ?recovered?, but follow-up AST values were not reported.Two liraglutide-treated patients were withdrawn from study due to events of elevated creatinephosphokinase (CPK). Patient 124003 was a 39 year old man who had a CPK of 361 (ULN179 after 6 months of liraglutide therapy. Liraglutide was withdrawn; a brief narrativestates that 6 days after withdrawal, the patient was recovering, but follow-up CPK was notreported. Patient 273015 was a 57 year old man who had a CPK of 207 after 9 months ofliraglutide. He also had a mild elevation of aspartate aminotransferase of 58 (ULN 43 He was withdrawn from study; follow-up CPK values are not mentioned. These elevations ofCPK are relatively mild, and do not represent rhabdomyolysis.The events of hypersensitivity were both reported as nonserious events, but resulted inwithdrawal from study. Patient 185006 was a 65 year old woman who developed ?delayedhypersensitivity reaction? after 28 days of LGT treatment. The event was not furthercharacterized. Liraglutide was discontinued and she was reported as recovered 6 days after theevent.

(Eiraglutide injection)7.1.3.3 Other significant adverse eventsMajor Adverse Cardiovascular Events7.l.3.3.1.l Introduction to the Review of Major Adverse Cardiovascular EventsThere has been a great deal of interest in the cardiovascular safety of drugs for the treatment ofdiabetes. This interest has resulted in two recent Advisory Committee meetings in July 2007 andJuly 2008. In the 2008 Advisory Committee meeting, the panel (populated by members of theEndocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee, members of the Drug Safety and RiskManagement Advisory Committee, and other diabetologists, cardiologists and statisticians) wasasked to discuss whether cardiovascular outcomes trials (or equivalent evidence ofcardiovascular safety) were needed for new drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.This panel recommended, by a vote of 14:2, that more extensive cardiovascular safetyassessment should be required. After that meeting, the Division of Metabolism andEndocrinology Products issued a Guidance for Industry regarding the evaluation ofcardiovascular risk in new antidiabetic therapies to treat type 2 diabetes. Please refer to thatGuidance for ?irther details. In the Guidance, prospective planning of an overall developmentprogram is recommended, in order that the eventual marketing application will contain adequateinformation for evaluation of cardiovascular risk. Some important elements of the guidanceinclude:0 All Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials should have prospective independent blinded adjudicationof major adverse cardiovascular events. The events should include cardiovascularmortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke, but could possibly include other majoradverse cardiovascular events.0 All Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials should be designed so that a meta-analysis can beperformed on the overall Phase 2/3 trial population.0 Patients at higher risk of cardiovascular events should be included in clinical trials.0 Prior to submission of a New Drug Application, the applicant must demonstrate that thedrug is unlikely to carry a signi?cantly increased risk of cardiovascular events. This maybe done by a meta-analysis of the overall Phase 2/3 development program, or by theaddition of a large single cardiovascular outcomes trial to the Phase 2/3 developmentprogram. In either instance, when the overall study drug is compared to the overallcontrol population, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the risk ratio ofthe chosen composite of major adverse cardiovascular events should be less than 1.8,prior to submission of the New Drug Application.- If the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is between 1.3 and 1.8, and theremainder of the overall risk-bene?t analysis supports -approval, a postmarketingcardiovascular outcomes trial will generally be required, this time with an upper bound ofthe 95% con?dence interval of less than 1.3. 0 If the premarketing upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is less than 1.3, and theremainder of the overall risk?bene?t analysis supports approval, a postmarketingcardiovascular outcomes trial might not be needed.This Guidance is important, but it is intended for drugs that are currently in development. At thetime that the Guidance was issued, Novo Nordisk had already submitted its New DrugPage 44 of 249	392314	395703
218	1	2	16	1	195	Clinical Safety ReviewKaren Muny Mahoney, MD, FACENDA 22341 Submission 000Victoza? (liraglutide injection)the speci?c MACE endpoint, some studies had 0 MACE events in one or both groups that werebeing compared. In this context, Dr. Derr, the FDA Biostatistician, did not identify one specificmethod of estimation that was preferable to others. For this reason, she evaluated the sensitivityof the upper 95% CI bound estimate across a selection of methods. An estimated upper 95% CIbound that varied greatly from method to method would suggest that there is an insuf?cientnumber of MACE events, or other inconsistencies among studies, to provide a stable estimate ofthe upper 95% CI bound.The methods that Novo and Dr. Derr used are the following, presented with a brief description ofthe advantages and. disadvantages of each method in the context of the MACE analysis in theliraglutide studies:0 Novo used an stratified, Cochran Mantel-Haenszel analysis (CMH). While thismethod is well-established for the analysis of incidence ratios, a limitation is that studies withMACE events in the comparator group are omitted from the estimate. The method relies on the assumption that the variance of the estimated ratio is approximatelynormally distributed. This assumption may not apply well in circumstances where the eventsare rare.0 Dr. Derr conducted an exact, stratified analysis, and obtained the estimates from StatXact7TMsoftware. This method uses a different approach to estimation than the approachused in the CMH analysis. -The exact method tends to be conservative, resulting in upper 95%.CI bounds that may be wider than they need to be. Another limitation is that studies with MACE events in the comparator group are omitted from the estimate.0 Dr. Derr also conducted a stratified fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis with acontinuity correction of 0.5 applied to studies with 0 events in one or both groups. Thisapproach permits studies with 0 events to be included in the estimate. However, incircumstances where the events are rare, the continuity correction can be quite in?uential inestimating the 95% CI bounds. In addition, Dr. Derr constructed forest plots to depict thestudy-by-study estimates as well as the overall estimate.Dr. Derr notes that all three methods are stratified, re?ecting her preference for this approach inthe context of the analysis of MACE events from the liraglutide studies. The primary reason forthis preference is the variety of designs in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, with different allocationratios of liraglutide to comparator and somewhat different study populations. Dr. Derr believesthat use of a stratified analysis in this context results in a more accurate point estimate for theincidence ratio than does use of an unstrati?ed analysis.Dr. Derr notes further that other estimation methods are available, and that this is not intended as. a comprehensive list of all available methods. In addition, Dr. Derr notes that other forms of thesummary statistic are available, such as the incidence difference and the incidence rate ratio (theincidence divided by the patient-years of exposure, expressed as a ratio between liraglutide andthe comparator). Novo also provided estimates for these summary statistics. However, thefocus in this document is on the incidence ratio and the three methods Dr. Derr selected forevaluating sensitivity. -Page 53 of 249	414427	417834

(liraglutide injection)procedures were somewhat more variable, with a wider range in the estimated 95% CI bounds.All 8 point estimates were Seven of the 8 upper 95% C1 bounds were with 2 being<1.3 (Tables 7.1.3.3.l .3.9-7.1 .3.3.1.3.12). For this reason Dr. Derr concluded that the estimatesfor the liraglutide versus active control were somewhat sensitive to the choice of estimationmethodology.The number of actual events for the liraglutide and active control groups is summarized in Table7.1.3.3.1.3.7. The number of events was small in most analyses. 1As mentioned earlier, time period Population A (in the Tables 7.l.3.3.1.3.2 through 7.1 includes all data from the randomized, controlled portions of the trials, out to measurement of theprimary endpoint. The ?Uniform? MACE analysis request had speci?cally requested data fromthe randomized, double-blind, controlled portions of the trials, out to measurement of theprimary endpoint. However, in four of the Phase 2/3 trials of liraglutide, a comparator arm wasopen-label prior to the primary endpoint. These arms were not excluded from the aboveanalyses, and that was the intent of the FDA request. Novo did comply completely with therequest, and performed additional analyses excluding these open-label arms, and submitted theanalyses on 13 Feb 2009.

One should not compare the percentages in the variouscells; they are only raw numbers used to illustrate event rates, and do not re?ect strati?cation bytrial. As an example of event rates, one can look at the middle (green-shaded) column forliraglutide group events. Even in the top row, with the highest number of events, one can seethat the event rates were low, with only 69, or of liraglutide-treated patients experiencingan event. As one moves down to the next LGT cell (change from Pop to Pop A), event ratesdrop due to omission of extension data. The clinical safety and statistical reviewersconsider Pop A to be more interpretable than Pop B, but less observation time results in fewerevents (69 to 51). Moving down to the next LGT cell, there is a large drop (from 51 to 16 events), as this cell no longer includes nonserious events, but only those that were characterizedas serious. This is because about half the events in the Broad SMQ were events of increasedCPK, and the vast majority were nonserious events. The bottom 3 rows of the table includeevent numbers contributing to the FDA Custom endpoint, rather than to the Broad MACEendpoint. The FDA Custom endpoint tended to be more specific, and therefore to have fewerevents (all other scenario elements being equal), than did the Broad MACE endpoint. Forexample, the scenario of Custom MACE, serious nonserious events, Pop B, had 21 events,while there were 69 events in the corresponding Broad MACE scenario. Taking out extensiondata dropped the number of liraglutide FDA Custom events from 21 to 13. Taking outPage 62 of 249	432345	435072

While these headlines dominated thenews of 2008-2009, a root cause of the crisis haslargely been ignored: over the last severaldecades, the U.S. government and corporationspushedextremefinancialderegulationworldwide using “trade” agreements.Stiglitz-led United Nations Commission Callsfor Reform of WTO’s Regulatory CeilingThe UN Commission of Experts, chaired by Nobel Prizewinning economist Joseph Stiglitz, noted that: “Theframework for financial market liberalization under theFinancial Services Agreement of the General Agreement onTrade in Services (GATS) under the WTO and, even more,similar provisions in bilateral trade agreements may restrictthe ability of governments to change the regulatory structurein ways which support financial stability, economic growth,and the welfare of vulnerable consumers and investors.”Starting in the late 1970s, the U.S. governmentand corporations pushed to redefine “finance”from a service that supports the real economyto a tradable commodity whose flow acrossborders should be uninhibited. Starting in thelate 1980s, they successfully pushed for financial services to be included in “trade” negotiations,including those establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). “The sector was truly unique inthat respect, and there is little doubt within the trade policy community that financial sector support inthe European Union and the United States was a determining force in concluding the FSA [WTOFinancial Services Agreement],” notes a study posted on the WTO’s own website.The WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the financial servicechapters of U.S. “Free Trade” Agreements (FTAs) limit the regulation of financial servicesectors subject to these agreements. The United States bound most banking and securities servicesto comply with these rules and made sizeable commitments in insurance. The “trade” pact rulessimply ban many common forms of financial regulation, even if such policies apply to domestic andforeign firms equally. U.S. government and corporate efforts in trade negotiations complementeddomestic lobbying to weaken and eventually repeal the New Deal’s system of banking regulation. Forinstance, the Glass-Steagall Act created a firewall between commercial and investment banks toprevent the former from speculating with consumers’ savings. But the 1997 U.S. WTO commitmentsnoted an intent to change Glass-Steagall to conform with WTO rules. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,which did so, passed in 1999 – the year the WTO’s Financial Services Agreement (FSA) took effect.Many people still assume “trade” pacts are about traditional matters, such as tariff cuts. In fact, theWTO, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other U.S. FTAs require signatories –including the United States – to conform domestic policies to a broad non-trade deregulatory agenda.Few in Congress read the legislation implementing the WTO in 1994 or NAFTA in 1993, much lessthe pacts’ actual 900-page texts. Congress didn’t even get a vote on the expanded U.S. financial servicederegulation commitments contained in the subsequent WTO FSA. But if any country’s laws fail tocomply with WTO, NAFTA or FTA rules, the laws can be challenged before foreign tribunals, andthe country can be subjected to indefinite trade sanctions until its laws meet “trade” pact dictates.While Congress has worked to reregulate banks and other financial firms since the crisis, it must alsoconfront “trade” agreement rules that conflict with those reforms and require domestic law toconform to the now-rejected model of extreme deregulation that caused the global economic crisis.For more information, contact Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch: 202-546-4996, www.TradeWatch.org	0	3901
694	1	1	95	1	2	The Problem: Overreaching “Trade” Agreement RulesSo-called “trade” agreements – both existing and proposed – limit the domestic-policy optionslawmakers can pursue in areas that are not trade-related. The WTO enforces 17 different agreements,only a handful of which relate to tariffs and quotas – the traditional terrain of “trade” policy. Others limitsubsidies governments can provide to green industries, forbid domestic economic stimulus funds frombeing directed to domestic workers and firms, set parameters for how our health-care system is managed,and even constrain how our federal and state governments can expend our tax dollars in governmentprocurement. NAFTA and similar FTAs contain analogous provisions, and also empower foreigninvestors to directly challenge governments for alleged violations.One of the most controversial WTO agreements is the GATS, which sets out rules for how countries canregulate their economies’ “service sectors.” What’s a service? Basically anything you can’t drop on yourfoot, from banking to energy, education to healthcare. The WTO Secretariat was unusually direct indescribing the GATS’ implications: “Governments are free in principle to pursue any national policy objectivesprovided the relevant measures are compatible with the GATS.”One of the most controversial service sectors covered by the GATS is finance. When many countriesinitially rejected the extreme banking, securities and insurance deregulation pushed by U.S. and Europeangovernments and corporations, additional negotiations were launched after the WTO was established topush for deeper commitments. In all, over 100 countries have WTO financial services commitments.The United States and other rich countries also committed to even greater deregulation by adopting anadditional WTO agreement, called the “Understanding on Commitments in Financial Services.” When allwas said and done, the United States was bound to extremely broad WTO obligations to stay out ofregulation of “banking,” “other financial services” and “insurance.” Consider just one sector that hasgained notoriety for contributing to the financial meltdown: derivatives. In the expansive WTO categorycalled “Trading of Securities and Derivative Products and Services Related Thereto,” the only policy spacethat the United States preserved for regulating derivatives was for onion futures. Really.Taken as a whole, the WTO’s limits on financial service sector regulation are expansive. These rules notonly guarantee foreign financial firms and their products access to U.S. markets, but also include numerousadditional rules that limit how our domestic governments may regulate foreign firms operating here:No new regulation: The United States agreed to a “standstill” provision which requires that we notcreate new regulations (or reverse liberalization) for the list of financial services bound to comply withWTO rules. This means that the United States has bound itself not to do what Congress and regulatorshave tried to do in the crisis’s wake – to create new financial service regulations.Certain forms of regulation banned outright: The United States agreed that it would not set limits onthe size of financial firms, the types of financial services one entity may provide or the types of legalentities through which a financial service may be provided in the broad array of financial services signedup to the WTO. These WTO rules conflict with countries’ efforts to put size limitations on banks (so thatthey do not become “too big too fail”) and to “firewall” different financial services (a policy tool used tolimit the spread of risk across sectors, as Glass-Steagall did between commercial and investment banking).No bans on risky financial service “products” in committed sectors: A WTO tribunal has alreadyruled that a ban, even if it applies to domestic and foreign firms, constitutes a forbidden “zero quota” thatviolates service sector market access obligations. This restriction conflicts with proposals to limit variousrisky investment instruments, such as certain derivatives.2	3902	7976
695	1	1	95	1	3	Treating foreign and domestic firms alike is not sufficient: The GATS market access limits on U.S.domestic regulation apply in absolute terms. In other words, even if a policy applies to domestic andforeign firms alike, if it goes beyond what WTO rules permit, it is forbidden. And, forms of regulation notoutright banned by these rules must not inadvertently “modify the conditions of competition in favor ofservices or service suppliers” of the United States, even if they apply identically to foreign and domesticfirms. Might aspects of the Wall Street bailout have “changed the conditions of competition” in favor ofU.S. firms? Other WTO members have begun reviewing just this question.Other non-discriminatory domestic regulations also subject to review: GATS subjects policies ofgeneral application that may affect service sector firms to review, with WTO tribunals empowered todetermine if they are “reasonable,” whether they “could not reasonably have been expected” and whether licensingand qualification requirements and technical standards limit foreign firms’ access.The only exception to these rules is viewed by many to be useless: WTO, NAFTA and other U.S.FTAs contain a “prudential exception” that can be invoked as a defense if a financial policy is challenged.However, the provision contains a clause that many deem “self-cancelling.” That is to say, theeffectiveness of the provision is at best contested in that its acceptable use is explicitly limited tocircumstances where invoking the exception does not contradict a country’s “trade” pact commitments.But a country would not use the exception unless it felt that a financial policy did just that.New WTO “Trade in Services Agreement”and Trans-Pacific Partnership FTAWould Require More Financial DeregulationEven as regulators worked to reregulate financial firms after the 2008-2009 crisis, U.S. tradenegotiators were trying to revive a beleaguered WTO expansion called the “Doha Round.” TheBush administration led a push to expand financial deregulation through this Round, which started in 2001.The Obama administration continued with the Bush agenda. The Doha Round has been deadlocked, andsome consider it altogether derailed. However, the United States has joined a small bloc of WTO countriesin trying to revive the financial deregulation agenda from the Doha Round by pushing for new “Trade inServices Agreement” (TISA) negotiations. Congress was notified of these negotiations in January 2013.The agenda of the TISA negotiations may include these Doha leftover initiatives:A new agreement setting additional constraints on domestic regulation. It seems unimaginablethat, in the current context, WTO negotiations would be underway to establish an agreement imposingnew, additional limits on regulation. But a “GATS Working Party on Domestic Regulations” is tryingto complete new rules that would do just that. The rules could empower WTO tribunals to secondguess governments on the subjective questions of whether policies are really necessary and whetherless trade-restrictive means to meet policy goals could be employed.A new agreement imposing limits on accountancy sector regulation. Arthur Andersen, of Enronaccounting scandal fame, helped formulate a WTO agreement establishing new “disciplines” on nondiscriminatory regulations in the accounting sector. These rules would pressure governments toderegulate accounting, rather than better regulate it, as multiple G-20 Communiqués have called for.In praising the launch of the TISA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted that banks and other firms“have seen trade and regulatory barriers multiply in ways that could not be foreseen two decades ago whenthe General Agreement on Trade in Services was negotiated.” The Chamber welcomed the TISA as a“chance to tackle emerging trade barriers” – a euphemism for post-crisis efforts to reregulate finance.3	7977	11860
696	1	1	95	1	4	The draft text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a NAFTA-style FTA under negotiationbetween the United States and 11 Pacific Rim countries, contains the same limits on financialregulation as the WTO, and more. In addition, foreign financial firms would be empowered to “sue”the U.S. government over financial regulations in foreign tribunals, which would be empowered to orderpayment of unlimted sums of U.S. taxpayer money if they saw new financial policies as undermining suchfirms’ “expectations.” Also, even as the International Monetary Fund has officially shifted from oppositionto qualified endorsement of capital controls, which are used to avoid destabilizing floods of speculativemoney into and out of countries, the TPP would ban the use of these important regulatory tools. Despiteyears of pressure from former House Financial Services Committee Chair Rep. Barney Frank to permitcapital controls, the Obama administration is the strongest promoter of this ban in the TPP.The Solution: Shrink or Sink (and Ignore) “Trade” PactLimits on Financial RegulationUnfortunately, some existing “trade” pact rules do limit the policy space nations need to prevent financialcrises. Other rules are at best unclear and can chill needed reforms. These rules must be changed.However, in the interim we cannot allow “trade” agreement rules to inhibit needed reform. Here’s ablueprint for change:First, do no further harm: no additionalfinancial deregulation via the TISA or the TPP.Demands for nations to add financial sectorcommitments must be jettisoned along with newregulation-limiting agreements.Fix existing WTO, NAFTA and FTA rules toremove financial deregulation requirements andadd safeguards for economic stability policies:The changes needed are straightforward. The issueis whether the political will exists. The neededchanges include removing automatic deregulationrequirements from “trade” pact service sectorliberalization rules, and adding a meaningfulsafeguard to protect prudential policies.WTO Rules Have Been Modified Before toAddress a Global CrisisIn the past, when WTO rules conflicted with global policypriorities, nations negotiated changes. The 2001 “DohaDeclaration on TRIPS and Public Health” countered WTOdrug-patent rules’ limits to a global response to theHIV/AIDS crisis. Like that pandemic, dealing with thefinancial crisis and avoiding future such crises is a globalemergency. Scores of WTO countries are seeking to implementthe very financial stabilization policies that could be attackedas WTO violations. With so many countries facing the sameWTO problems, changes could find wide support.It takes years for a trade agreement challenge to get an initial ruling, so policymakers should notallow threats of challenges to be used as a tool to scale back reregulation: Industry groups like theU.S. Chamber of Commerce are already using the deregulatory WTO rules to threaten new financialregulations by trying to raise the specter that their implementation could spark trade disputes. But even if anew financial regulation would conflict with “trade” pact rules, a country must formally challenge thepolicy for dispute resolution action to be initiated. After a challenge is brought, it typically takes more thanfive years before issuance of a final WTO ruling that could result in trade sanctions. Thus, the “way to go”is to ignore the threats, implement robust financial regulations, and see if it draws an actual challenge.For access to a database detailing U.S. GATS service-sector commitments,along with fact sheets and other informational material about “trade” pactrules affecting financial regulation, please contact Public Citizen’s GlobalTrade Watch at 202-546-4996, or visit our website: www.TradeWatch.org.4	11861	15614

We previously published a preliminary MBMA of literaturedata on the predictability of HbA1c treatment effect at Week 12 fromWeek 4 HbA1c response using summary-level data.4 The objectivesof this expanded MBMA were to characterize the time course ofantidiabetic drug effect on HbA1c and the predictability of long-termefficacy from short-term data in T2DM.MethodsThe database included study-level longitudinal aggregate data from334 blinded, randomized, active- or placebo-controlled trials inT2DM of 2 to 260 weeks in duration, with metformin and 27 otherdrugs in 5 drug classes (DPP4: dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors;GLP1: glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists; SGLT2: sodiumglucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors; SU: sulfonylureas; TZD:thiazolidinediones).HbA1c change from baseline (CFB) was described by:ΔYijt  Eoit Emax ,class  f (t )  (1   i ,drug )  DoseijtDoseijt  ED50 ,drug εijt⁻ ΔYijt is the mean HbA1c CFB in the ith trial, jth arm, at time t.⁻ Eoit is the non-parametric fixed placebo effect for the ith trial at time t.⁻ Emax,class is the maximal treatment effect specific to each drug class,except for SGLT2 inhibitors, which were adjusted to account fordifferent degrees of non-selective SGLT1 inhibition by each drug.⁻ f(t) is the time course function for Emax,class .⁻ ED50,drug is the drug-specific dose to achieve 50% of Emax.class .⁻ i,drug is a trial- and drug-specific random effect to describe betweentrial and drug heterogeneity in treatment effects.⁻ ijt is the residual variability in the ith trial, jth arm, at time t.Since not all trials reported the variability of the mean HbA1c CFB,SDit was calculated using the following Equation:Table 1.

For combinationtreatments, an interaction coefficient was estimated for each drugclass combination.The final model was evaluated by visual predictive check acrossdoses and drugs in all drug classes and time.Prediction from shorter-term to long-term efficacy: One thousandsimulations of the time-course of treatment effects for each drugclass were performed by random sampling of the fixed effectparameters (multivariate normal distribution) and the random effect(normal distribution) from the final model. The ratios of treatmenteffects at the selected time points were calculated, and the meanand the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the ratios were summarized.R3.0.2 was used for data processing, modeling and simulations.ResultsObserved (symbols an whiskers, weighted mean and 95% CI) and modelpredicted mean (solid line) time-course of treatment effects on HbA1c byrepresentative drugs at respective median doses across trials.Emax (%, diet background)ET50 (weeks)ntTdurDPP4-0.919 [-0.998 to -0.840]8.60 [7.53 to 9.82]0.550 [0.516 to 0.583]-0.411 [-0.491 to -0.333]GLP1-1.69 [-1.88 to -1.50]9.25 [7.90 to 10.8]0.480 [0.445 to 0.515]-0.408 [-0.486 to -0.331]SGLT2-0.917 [-1.01 to -0.828]4.16 [3.71 to 4.67]0.660 [ 0.551 to 0.769]-0.050 [-0.104 to 0.004]Metformin-1.81 [-2.08 to -1.53]10.9 [8.74 to 13.7]0.469 [0.413 to 0.525]-0.306 [-0.408 to -0.204]SU-1.68 [-1.86 to -1.50]13.6 [12.1 to 15.4]0.589 [0.559 to 0.620]-0.685 [-0.768 to -0.602]TZD-1.78 [-2.07 to -1.50]10.7 [9.91 to 11.6]0.916 [0.844 to 0.988]-0.201 [-0.264 to -0.137]The model predicted a drug class dependent Emax, and drug class dependent onset and loss oftreatment effects.HbA1c BSL was found to be a significant covariate on Emax, e.g. a 36% higher Emax for HbA1c BSL of9% vs. 8%. Background treatments with oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin were predicted to resultin mean decreases in Emax relative to diet background by 5.5%21.3% and 16.4%65.5%,respectively, across drug classes. Studies conducted in Japan were estimated to have 55.7% and49.0% higher Emax in DPP4 and GLP1 drug classes, respectively, relative to studies conducted outsideof Japan.Table 3.

Thetreatment effects at Week 26 were predicted to be similar to those at Week 12. For drug classeswith loss of efficacy over time (e.g. SU, DPP4, GLP1), this was predicted to be more evident at Week52 than Week 26. The longitudinal model can also predict efficacy with different treatments in adrug class and in different populations, e.g. patients with different background treatments and/orwith different HbA1c BSL. The model also provides benchmarks of efficacy time-course for newantidiabetic drug classes.ConclusionsThe time course function was described by:Tdur classWeek 12/41.94 [1.89 to 2.00]1.88 [1.83 to 1.93]1.74 [1.68 to 1.80]2.30 [2.17 to 2.42]2.11 [2.03 to 2.19]5.84 [4.99 to 6.90]The longitudinal MBMA adequately characterized the time courses of antidiabetic drug effects inT2DM. Long-term efficacy may be confidently predicted from short-term efficacy within a drugclass. A 26-week trial duration may not add value over 12 weeks to understand peak treatmenteffect, and may not be sufficient to discern durability of treatment effect.References1.2.3.4.Mandema J, et al.
